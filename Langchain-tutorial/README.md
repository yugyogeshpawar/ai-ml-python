Create and activate a virtual environment. This is a best practice to isolate project dependencies.

**On macOS/Linux:**
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

**On Windows:**
```bash
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

Once the virtual environment is activated, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Let's begin our journey into LangChain!
