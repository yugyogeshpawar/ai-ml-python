# Part 3: Advanced - Customization and Deployment

Welcome to Part 3 of the LangChain tutorial. In this final section, we will explore the advanced features of LangChain that allow for deep customization, production-level deployment, and modern development practices.

## Topics Covered

1.  **LangChain Expression Language (LCEL):** The new, declarative way to compose chains. This is a crucial topic for modern LangChain development.
2.  **Custom Chains and Agents:** Creating your own custom chains and agents for specialized tasks.
3.  **LangServe:** Easily deploying your LangChain application as a REST API.
4.  **Streaming:** How to stream responses from your LangChain applications for a better user experience.

## Project

At the end of this part, you will build a research agent that can browse the web, read articles, and summarize the findings on a given topic. You will then deploy this agent as a REST API using LangServe.

Let's get started with the first topic: [LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)](./01-lcel/README.md).
