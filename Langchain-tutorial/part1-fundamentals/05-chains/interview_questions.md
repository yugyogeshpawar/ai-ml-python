# Interview Questions: Chains in LangChain

### Q1: What is a Chain in LangChain, and what is its primary purpose?

**Answer:**

A Chain in LangChain is a construct that combines multiple components, like a Prompt Template and an LLM, into a single, executable unit. Its primary purpose is to streamline the process of executing a sequence of operations. Instead of manually formatting a prompt, passing it to an LLM, and then processing the output, a Chain encapsulates this entire workflow. You simply provide the initial inputs, and the Chain handles the rest, returning the final output.

### Q2: What is the `LLMChain`, and what are its core components?

**Answer:**

The `LLMChain` is the most fundamental and commonly used type of Chain in LangChain. It provides a simple and direct way to run a query against a language model.

Its core components are:

1.  **A Prompt Template (`PromptTemplate`):** This defines the structure of the prompt and the input variables it expects.
2.  **A Language Model (`LLM` or `ChatModel`):** This is the model that will process the formatted prompt and generate a response.

The `LLMChain` takes input variables, uses the `PromptTemplate` to format them into a prompt, sends the prompt to the `LLM`, and returns the model's output.

### Q3: What is a `SequentialChain` and how does it differ from a simple `LLMChain`?

**Answer:**

A `SequentialChain` is a more advanced type of chain that allows you to connect multiple chains in a sequence, where the output of one chain becomes the input for the next. This is a powerful way to build complex, multi-step workflows.

Here's how it differs from an `LLMChain`:

*   **`LLMChain`:** Represents a single step (prompt + LLM).
*   **`SequentialChain`:** Represents a series of steps, composed of multiple chains.

There are two types of sequential chains:

1.  **`SimpleSequentialChain`:** The simplest form, where each step has one input and one output, and the output of one step is passed directly as the input to the next.
2.  **`SequentialChain`:** A more general form that allows for multiple inputs and outputs at each step, giving you more control over how data flows between the chains.

Here's a conceptual example of a `SequentialChain`:

1.  **Chain 1 (Name Generator):** Takes a `product` and generates a `company_name`.
2.  **Chain 2 (Slogan Generator):** Takes the `company_name` (the output from Chain 1) and generates a `slogan`.

A `SequentialChain` would orchestrate this, so you could provide a `product` and get back a `slogan` after both chains have run in order.
