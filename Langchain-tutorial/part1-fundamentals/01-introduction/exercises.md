# Exercises: Introduction to LangChain

These exercises are designed to help you reflect on the core concepts of LangChain.

### Exercise 1: Your Own Words

In your own words, write a one-paragraph explanation of what LangChain is and what problem it solves. This will help solidify your understanding of its purpose.

### Exercise 2: Identify a Use Case

Think of a real-world application you use regularly (e.g., a customer support chatbot, a recommendation engine, a personal assistant). How could LangChain be used to build or improve this application? List at least two LangChain components (e.g., Agents, Memory, Indexes) that would be relevant and explain why.

### Exercise 3: Compare and Contrast

Create a simple table comparing the process of building an LLM application with and without LangChain. Consider aspects like:

*   Connecting to an LLM
*   Managing prompts
*   Connecting to external data
*   Using external tools

This will help you appreciate the value that LangChain provides.
