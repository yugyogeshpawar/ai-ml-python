# Part 1: The Fundamentals of LangChain

Welcome to Part 1 of the LangChain tutorial. In this section, we will cover the foundational concepts of LangChain. By the end of this part, you will have a solid understanding of the core components and be able to build simple LangChain applications.

## Topics Covered

1.  **Introduction to LangChain:** What it is, why it's useful, and its main components.
2.  **Setup:** How to install LangChain and set up your environment.
3.  **LLMs:** Connecting to and using Language Models.
4.  **Prompt Templates:** Creating dynamic and reusable prompts.
5.  **Chains:** Combining LLMs and prompts to create simple applications.
6.  **Output Parsers:** Structuring the output from LLMs.

## Project

At the end of this part, you will build a simple command-line application that takes a topic and generates a short blog post about it.

Let's get started with the first topic: [Introduction to LangChain](./01-introduction/README.md).
