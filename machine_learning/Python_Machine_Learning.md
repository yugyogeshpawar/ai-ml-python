# Python Machine Learning - Statistics Assignments

## Mean, Median, and Mode

1. Write a Python script to calculate the mean of a list of numbers.
2. Write a Python function to calculate the median of a given dataset.
3. Use the `statistics` module to find the mode of a dataset.
4. Create a dataset and use NumPy to compute mean, median, and mode.
5. Compare the results of mean, median, and mode for a skewed dataset.
6. Visualize the dataset and highlight the mean, median, and mode using matplotlib.
7. Explain with code how outliers affect mean vs. median.

## Standard Deviation

8. Write a Python function to calculate standard deviation manually.
9. Use NumPy to compute standard deviation of a dataset.
10. Compare standard deviations of two datasets and explain the results.
11. Visualize a normal distribution and indicate the standard deviation bands.
12. Explain the 68-95-99.7 rule using a sample dataset.
13. Create a histogram to show how data is distributed around the mean.
14. Apply standard deviation to detect anomalies in a dataset.

## Percentiles

15. Use NumPy to find the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles of a dataset.
16. Plot a boxplot and explain the significance of percentiles.
17. Create a function to calculate any percentile manually.
18. Explain the difference between percentile and percentile rank with examples.
19. Use percentiles to detect outliers in a dataset.
20. Generate a synthetic dataset and divide it into quartiles.

## Advanced Concepts and Applications

21. Normalize a dataset using Z-score normalization.
22. Use sklearnâ€™s `StandardScaler` to standardize data.
23. Compare raw vs. standardized data using boxplots.
24. Write a script to preprocess a dataset using mean imputation for missing values.
25. Perform feature scaling and explain its impact on ML algorithms.
26. Analyze a real-world dataset (e.g., Iris, Titanic) and compute basic statistics.
27. Use descriptive statistics to summarize the features of a dataset.
28. Explain the difference between population and sample standard deviation with examples.
29. Combine statistical functions to prepare a feature summary report.
30. Create a mini project that loads a dataset, analyzes it using mean, median, mode, std dev, and percentiles, and presents insights visually.
