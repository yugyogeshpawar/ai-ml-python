Perfect 🚀 let’s dive into this.
This is a very common doubt when people start with **LangGraph** since it builds **on top of LangChain**.

# **When to use LangGraph over plain LangChain**

## 1. First, quick recap:

* **LangChain** → Helps you connect LLMs (like GPT) with tools, memory, and data sources.
  It’s good for **linear** or **simple branching workflows**.

* **LangGraph** → A framework for building **graphs of nodes** (like agents, tools, retrievers, decision points) with **state management**.
  It’s better for **complex, multi-step workflows** that may loop, branch, or coordinate multiple agents.

---

## 2. Use **LangChain** when:

* Your workflow is **simple**.
  Example:

  ```
  User → LLM → Output
  ```
* You only need **basic chains**:

  * Prompt templates
  * Simple tool calling
  * Basic RAG (Retrieve & Answer)
* You don’t need complex memory or coordination.

👉 Example:
"Take a user’s question, search docs, and give an answer."
That’s a **linear chain** → LangChain is enough.

---

## 3. Use **LangGraph** when:

* You need **complex workflows** with:

  * Branching (different paths depending on conditions)
  * Cycles/loops (e.g., agent retries until success)
  * Multiple agents talking to each other
  * Long-term **state tracking** across steps

* You want **deterministic control** over how your app flows, not just "LLM decides everything."

* You’re building **agent systems** (where the LLM plans, acts, and re-thinks).

👉 Example:
"An AI assistant that:

1. Reads a user query,
2. Decides if it needs a web search or calculator,
3. Calls the right tool,
4. If result is wrong → retry → else give final answer."

This requires **graph structure with loops** → LangGraph.

---

## 4. Simple Analogy 🏗️

* **LangChain = Lego blocks** → You can build simple houses quickly.
* **LangGraph = Lego city planner** → You can organize blocks into complex cities with roads, loops, and traffic rules.

---

## 5. Quick Example:

### LangChain

```python
from langchain import LLMChain
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template("Summarize: {text}")
llm = ChatOpenAI()
chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt)

result = chain.run("LangChain is a framework...")
```

➡️ Simple, one-shot workflow.

---

### LangGraph

```python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END

def step1(state): return {"x": state["x"] + 1}
def step2(state): return {"x": state["x"] * 2}

workflow = StateGraph(dict)
workflow.add_node("add", step1)
workflow.add_node("multiply", step2)

workflow.set_entry_point("add")
workflow.add_edge("add", "multiply")
workflow.add_edge("multiply", END)

app = workflow.compile()
print(app.invoke({"x": 3}))
```

➡️ A **graph workflow**: Add → Multiply → End.
You can expand with loops, branches, etc.

---

✅ **In short:**

* Use **LangChain** → for simple, straight pipelines.
* Use **LangGraph** → when you need **agents, loops, branching, and state management**.

Do you want me to make a **table of differences (LangChain vs LangGraph)** so you can revise quickly later like notes?
