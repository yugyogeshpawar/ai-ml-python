# **DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) vs Cyclic Graphs**

## 1. What is a Graph?

A **graph** is just a collection of **nodes (points)** and **edges (arrows/lines)** that connect them.
In LangGraph (and many AI workflows), these graphs represent **how steps (nodes)** are connected to each other.

---

## 2. Directed Graph

If the arrows (edges) **have a direction** (A → B), we call it a **directed graph**.
It means: "do this first, then that."

---

## 3. DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)

* **Directed** = arrows point in one direction.
* **Acyclic** = **no loops** (you can’t go in circles).

👉 This is the most common structure in workflows (including LangGraph).
Why? Because you usually want to **start → process → finish**, without getting stuck.

### Example:

Imagine you’re making a cup of tea 🍵

1. **Boil water** →
2. **Put tea bag in cup** →
3. **Pour water into cup** →
4. **Drink tea**

Here, every step flows in **one direction**, and you don’t go back to "boil water" again.

That’s a **DAG**.

---

## 4. Cyclic Graph

* **Cyclic** = it **has a loop**.
* You can go around in circles.

👉 Sometimes useful when you want **feedback loops**, e.g., repeat until success.

### Example:

Imagine training a student 📚

1. **Teach lesson** →
2. **Test student** →
3. If student fails → go back to **Teach lesson** → **Test again**

This creates a **cycle** (loop).
It doesn’t end until the student passes.

---

## 5. Visual Difference

### DAG

```
A → B → C → D
```

Flow goes forward, no turning back.

### Cyclic Graph

```
A → B → C
↑         ↓
└─────────┘
```

Flow comes back and repeats.

---

## 6. Why is this important in LangGraph?

* **DAGs**: Good for **straight pipelines** (e.g., Input → Model → Output).
* **Cyclic graphs**: Good for **agents** that need to "think, act, and re-think" (looping until they reach an answer).

---

✅ **In short:**

* DAG = straight workflow, no loops.
* Cyclic Graph = workflow with loops (feedback).

Do you want me to also show you **how DAGs and Cyclic Graphs look in LangGraph code (Python examples)** so it’s easier to connect theory with practice?
