## Normal Distribution (4 Questions)
1. **Light Bulb Lifespan**:  
   A factory produces light bulbs with a lifespan that follows a normal distribution. The mean lifespan is 1,000 hours with a standard deviation of 100 hours.  
   - What is the probability that a randomly selected light bulb lasts between 900 and 1,100 hours?

2. **Student Test Scores**:  
   The test scores of a large class are normally distributed with a mean of 75 and a standard deviation of 10.  
   - What percentage of students scored above 85?

3. **Height of Adults**:  
   The heights of adult males are normally distributed with a mean of 5.9 feet and a standard deviation of 0.2 feet.  
   - What is the probability of selecting a male taller than 6.1 feet?

4. **Daily Temperatures**:  
   The daily high temperature in a city in summer is normally distributed with a mean of 30°C and a standard deviation of 3°C.
