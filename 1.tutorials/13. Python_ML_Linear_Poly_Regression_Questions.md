# Python Machine Learning Questions

## Interview Perspective

1. What is Linear Regression in Machine Learning and how does it work?
2. Explain the cost function used in Linear Regression.
3. What are the key assumptions of Linear Regression?
4. How do you evaluate the performance of a Linear Regression model?
5. What is the difference between simple and multiple Linear Regression?
6. Can Linear Regression be used for non-linear data? Why or why not?
7. What are some common metrics used to evaluate a regression model?
8. What is Polynomial Regression and how does it differ from Linear Regression?
9. When would you prefer Polynomial Regression over Linear Regression?
10. Explain the concept of overfitting in Polynomial Regression and how to prevent it.

## Practice Perspective

1. Implement a simple Linear Regression model using Python's scikit-learn library.
2. Create a dataset with a single feature and perform Linear Regression on it.
3. Plot the regression line for a Linear Regression model using Matplotlib.
4. Implement Polynomial Regression for a given dataset and visualize the results.
5. Compare the performance of Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression on the same dataset.
6. Use scikit-learn's `train_test_split` to split your dataset and evaluate a Linear Regression model.
7. Use PolynomialFeatures from scikit-learn to create polynomial terms for Polynomial Regression.
8. Write a Python script to calculate the Mean Squared Error for a regression model.
9. Fit a Linear Regression model to multi-dimensional data and evaluate its performance.
10. Experiment with different degrees of Polynomial Regression and observe the effect on overfitting.
