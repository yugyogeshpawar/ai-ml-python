# Python `match` Statement – Assignment Questions

### Beginner Level

1. **Basic Matching**

   * Write a Python program using `match` to check a number from 1 to 3 and print its name (e.g., 1 = "One").

2. **Simple String Matching**

   * Ask the user to input a day of the week (e.g., "Monday") and use `match` to print if it's a weekday or weekend.

3. **Match with Default Case**

   * Use `match` to print a color's meaning (e.g., "red" = "Stop", "green" = "Go"). If the color is not known, print "Unknown color".

4. **Match with Integer Ranges**

   * Match an exam score (0-100) and return a grade (A, B, C, D, F).

5. **Using `match` with Tuples**

   * Create a `match` block that takes a coordinate like `(x, y)` and prints if it's on the X-axis, Y-axis, or origin.

### Intermediate Level

6. **Match with Multiple Patterns**

   * Match an input to multiple cases (e.g., "cat", "dog", "rabbit" → "Animal").

7. **Nested Match**

   * Use `match` inside another `match`. For example, match a product type and then match the brand.

8. **Match on Data Types**

   * Write a function that takes any input and uses `match` to print the type (int, float, str, list).

### Advanced Level

9. **Pattern Matching with Lists**

   * Use `match` to analyze a list like `[1, 2, 3]`, `[1]`, `[]` and print different messages depending on the length and values.

10. **Custom Class Pattern Matching**

* Create a class `Person(name, age)` and use `match` to print different messages based on age group (child, teen, adult, senior).
