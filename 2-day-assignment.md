# Python Arithmetic and Assignment Operators - Simple Questions

## Python Arithmetic Operators

1. **Addition**
   - Given two variables `x = 7` and `y = 3`, use the addition operator to find the sum and print the result.

2. **Subtraction**
   - Given two variables `a = 12` and `b = 5`, use the subtraction operator to find the difference and print the result.

3. **Multiplication**
   - Given `num1 = 6` and `num2 = 4`, use the multiplication operator to find the product and print the result.

4. **Division**
   - Given `dividend = 20` and `divisor = 4`, use the division operator to find the quotient and print the result.

5. **Modulus**
   - Given `number = 17` and `divisor = 3`, use the modulus operator to find the remainder and print the result.

6. **Exponentiation**
   - Given `base = 2` and `exponent = 5`, use the exponentiation operator to calculate the power and print the result.

7. **Floor Division**
   - Given `x = 15` and `y = 2`, use the floor division operator to find the quotient and print the result.

8. **Combining Arithmetic Operators**
   - Given `a = 5`, `b = 10`, and `c = 2`, calculate the result of the expression `(a + b) * c - b / c` and print the result.

9. **Operator Precedence**
   - Evaluate the following expression: `5 + 3 * 2 - 8 / 4 ** 2` and print the result.

10. **Using Parentheses**
    - Use parentheses to change the order of operations in the expression `7 + 2 * 5 - 3 / 2` and print the result.

## Python Assignment Operators

11. **Simple Assignment**
    - Assign the value `15` to a variable `x` and print the value of `x`.

12. **Addition Assignment**
    - Given `x = 10`, use the addition assignment operator (`+=`) to add `5` to `x` and print the updated value.

13. **Subtraction Assignment**
    - Given `y = 20`, use the subtraction assignment operator (`-=`) to subtract `7` from `y` and print the updated value.

14. **Multiplication Assignment**
    - Given `z = 8`, use the multiplication assignment operator (`*=`) to multiply `z` by `4` and print the updated value.

15. **Division Assignment**
    - Given `w = 36`, use the division assignment operator (`/=`) to divide `w` by `6` and print the updated value.

16. **Modulus Assignment**
    - Given `number = 19`, use the modulus assignment operator (`%=`) to get the remainder when divided by `4` and print the updated value.

17. **Exponentiation Assignment**
    - Given `a = 3`, use the exponentiation assignment operator (`**=`) to raise `a` to the power of `3` and print the updated value.

18. **Floor Division Assignment**
    - Given `b = 25`, use the floor division assignment operator (`//=`) to divide `b` by `4` and print the updated value.

19. **Chaining Assignment**
    - Assign the value `100` to three variables `x`, `y`, and `z` in one line, then print all three.

20. **Combining Assignment and Arithmetic**
    - Given `p = 10`, use the assignment operator to increase the value of `p` by `5`, multiply it by `3`, then subtract `4` and print the final result.
