# Python NumPy Assignment Questions

## Beginner Level

1. What is NumPy, and how do you install it?
2. Create a 1-dimensional NumPy array with elements 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
3. Create a 2x3 NumPy array filled with zeros.
4. Generate a NumPy array with random integers between 0 and 10 (size 5).
5. Find the shape and size of a given NumPy array.
6. Convert a Python list `[10, 20, 30]` into a NumPy array.
7. Create an array of evenly spaced values between 1 and 10 with a step size of 2.
8. Create a 4x4 identity matrix using NumPy.
