# Python Machine Learning - Multiple Regression Questions

## Interview Perspective

1. What is Multiple Regression in Machine Learning?
2. How does Multiple Regression differ from Simple Linear Regression?
3. What are the assumptions of Multiple Regression?
4. Explain the role of independent variables in Multiple Regression.
5. What is multicollinearity, and how does it affect Multiple Regression models?
6. How do you interpret the coefficients of a Multiple Regression model?
7. What are the key evaluation metrics for Multiple Regression?
8. How do you handle categorical variables in Multiple Regression?
9. Explain the concept of adjusted R-squared and its importance in Multiple Regression.
10. How can you determine the significance of predictors in a Multiple Regression model?

## Practice Perspective

1. Implement a Multiple Regression model using scikit-learn.
2. Create a synthetic dataset with multiple features and apply Multiple Regression.
3. Use a dataset like the Boston Housing dataset to perform Multiple Regression.
4. Visualize the relationships between features and the target variable in a Multiple Regression model.
5. Apply feature scaling to improve the performance of a Multiple Regression model.
6. Implement backward elimination to select significant predictors for a Multiple Regression model.
7. Use statsmodels to fit a Multiple Regression model and interpret the summary output.
8. Write a Python script to compute the R-squared value for a Multiple Regression model.
9. Experiment with adding and removing features to observe changes in model performance.
10. Use `train_test_split` to split your data and evaluate the performance of a Multiple Regression model.
