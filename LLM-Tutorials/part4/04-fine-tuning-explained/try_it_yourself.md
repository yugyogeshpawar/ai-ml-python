# Try It Yourself: Experiencing a Fine-Tuned Model

Actually fine-tuning a model is a complex process that requires significant coding and data preparation. However, you can easily experience the *results* of fine-tuning by interacting with models that have been specialized for a particular task.

---

### The Scenario

We are going to compare a general-purpose model with a model that has been specifically fine-tuned to be good at programming.

*   **The Generalist (GP):** A standard, base model like GPT-4 or Claude 3 Sonnet. It's very smart and knows a lot about code, but it's also a generalist.
*   **The Specialist (Cardiologist):** A model that has been fine-tuned on a massive dataset of code and programming discussions. A great example is **Codestral**, a new open-source model from Mistral AI, which is specifically designed for code generation.

### Exercise: The Code Generation Challenge

1.  **Go to a standard chatbot.** Open up ChatGPT, Claude, or whichever chatbot you prefer that uses a general-purpose model.

2.  **Give it a slightly tricky coding-related prompt.** You don't need to understand the code itself, just the request.
    > You are a Python expert. Write a simple Python function that takes a list of strings and returns a new list containing only the strings that are palindromes (read the same forwards and backwards). Include a brief explanation of how the code works.

3.  **Analyze the output.** The general-purpose model will likely do a very good job. It will produce a correct function and a good explanation. It's a very capable GP.

4.  **Now, go to a specialized, fine-tuned code model.** We can use the Hugging Face Space for Codestral.
    *   **Open the Codestral Space:** [https://huggingface.co/spaces/mistralai/Codestral-22B-v0.1](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mistralai/Codestral-22B-v0.1)

5.  **Give it the exact same prompt.**
    > You are a Python expert. Write a simple Python function that takes a list of strings and returns a new list containing only the strings that are palindromes (read the same forwards and backwards). Include a brief explanation of how the code works.

6.  **Compare the two responses.** Look closely at the differences.
    *   **Code Quality:** Is the code from Codestral more "Pythonic" or efficient? A common way to check for a palindrome in Python is the elegant slice `s == s[::-1]`. A fine-tuned model is more likely to know and use this specific, high-quality pattern.
    *   **Explanation:** Is the explanation more direct and to the point? A code-specific model might waste less time on conversational filler.
    *   **Formatting:** Does the fine-tuned model do a better job of using markdown to format the code block and the explanation?

**Reflection:**
While the difference might be subtle for a simple problem, on more complex coding tasks, it becomes much more pronounced. The fine-tuned model "thinks" in code. It has adjusted its weights to be exceptionally good at predicting the next *token of code*. It knows the common patterns, libraries, and idioms of programming languages at a much deeper level than a generalist model.

This is the power of fine-tuning: it creates a true specialist. You have just seen the difference between a very smart GP and a world-class Cardiologist for a heart problem.
