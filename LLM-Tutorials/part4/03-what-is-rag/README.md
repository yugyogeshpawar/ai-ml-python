# Part 4: Building with AI: Your First Projects
## Topic 3: What is RAG?

A standard Large Language Model's knowledge is "frozen in time." It only knows about the information that was included in its massive (but static) training dataset. It has no knowledge of recent events, your private documents, or your company's specific data.

So how can we make an LLM answer questions about information it wasn't trained on? One of the most powerful and popular techniques to solve this problem is called **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**, or **RAG**.

### The "Open-Book" vs. "Closed-Book" Test

Imagine you have to take a history test.

*   **A standard LLM is like taking a closed-book test.** It has to answer every question based purely on what it managed to memorize during its training (studying). While it has memorized a lot, its knowledge is limited, might be out of date, and it can sometimes misremember facts (hallucinate).

*   **An LLM using RAG is like taking an open-book test.** Before answering a question, the model gets to look up the relevant information from a specific, approved textbook (your data). It then uses the information it just retrieved to construct its answer.

> **Simple Definition:** RAG is a technique that gives an LLM access to a specific set of external documents. When a user asks a question, the system first **retrieves** the most relevant documents and then passes them to the LLM along with the original question to **generate** an answer.

This process allows the LLM to answer questions about information it has never seen before, making it a game-changer for building practical applications.

### How Does RAG Work? A Two-Step Process

A RAG system works in two main stages:

#### Stage 1: Indexing (The "Filing Cabinet" Phase)

This is a one-time setup process where you prepare your documents so they can be easily searched.

1.  **Load Documents:** You start with your source of information (e.g., a set of PDFs, a website's text, a database of company policies).
2.  **Chunking:** The documents are broken down into smaller, manageable chunks (e.g., paragraphs or pages). You can't give the model a whole book at once.
3.  **Embedding:** Each chunk is converted into an embedding vector using an embedding model (just like we learned in Part 2). This vector represents the meaning of the chunk.
4.  **Storing in a Vector Database:** All these embedding vectors are stored in a special kind of database called a **vector database**. This database is highly optimized for one specific task: finding the vectors that are closest or most similar to a given query vector.

At the end of this stage, you have a searchable "library" of your documents, where each chunk is indexed by its semantic meaning.

#### Stage 2: Retrieval and Generation (The "Answering a Question" Phase)

This happens every time a user asks a question.

1.  **User Query:** The user asks a question, for example, "What is our company's policy on remote work?"
2.  **Embed the Query:** The user's question is also converted into an embedding vector using the same embedding model.
3.  **Search the Vector Database:** The system takes the query vector and uses it to search the vector database. It asks the database, "Find me the top 3-5 text chunks whose vectors are most similar to this query vector." This is the **Retrieval** step.
4.  **Augment the Prompt:** The system now constructs a new, more detailed prompt for the LLM. It combines the original question with the relevant chunks it just retrieved. The prompt looks something like this:
    > **[Role]** You are a helpful assistant.
    > **[Context]** Use the following retrieved documents to answer the user's question. Do not use any other knowledge.
    >
    > **Retrieved Document 1:** "Policy #4.1: Remote work is permitted for all employees level 5 and above..."
    > **Retrieved Document 2:** "All remote employees must connect to the company VPN during work hours..."
    >
    > **[Task]** User's Question: What is our company's policy on remote work?

5.  **Generate the Answer:** This augmented prompt is sent to the LLM. The model now has the exact information it needs to answer the question accurately. This is the **Generation** step.

### Why is RAG so Important?

*   **Reduces Hallucinations:** The model is grounded in the provided text, making it much less likely to make things up.
*   **Uses Up-to-Date Information:** You can constantly update your vector database with new documents, allowing the AI to answer questions about recent information.
*   **Provides Citations:** Because you know which chunks were retrieved, you can tell the user exactly where the AI got its information from, which builds trust.

RAG is one of the most practical and impactful techniques in the AI world today, forming the foundation of thousands of real-world applications.
