# 05 Fine-tuning LLMs

## Introduction

This tutorial covers the process of fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) to adapt them to specific tasks.

## What is Fine-tuning?

Fine-tuning is the process of taking a pre-trained LLM and further training it on a specific dataset to adapt it to a particular task or domain. This allows you to leverage the knowledge learned by the pre-trained model while tailoring it to your specific needs.

## Why Fine-tune LLMs?

*   **Improved Performance:** Fine-tuning can significantly improve the performance of an LLM on a specific task compared to using the pre-trained model directly.
*   **Domain Adaptation:** Fine-tuning allows you to adapt an LLM to a specific domain or style of writing.
*   **Task Specialization:** Fine-tuning enables you to specialize an LLM for tasks like question answering, text summarization, or code generation.

## Different Fine-tuning Techniques

*   **Full Fine-tuning:** Training all the parameters of the LLM. This can be computationally expensive.
*   **Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT):** Techniques that fine-tune only a small subset of the model's parameters, reducing computational cost. Examples include:
    *   **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation):** Adds trainable low-rank matrices to the model's layers.
    *   **Prefix Tuning:** Adds a trainable prefix to the input sequence.
    *   **Prompt Tuning:** Optimizes a set of continuous prompts.

## Data Preparation for Fine-tuning

*   **Dataset Selection:** Choose a dataset relevant to your target task or domain.
*   **Data Cleaning:** Clean and preprocess the data to ensure quality.
*   **Data Formatting:** Format the data in a way that is compatible with the LLM and the fine-tuning process. This often involves creating input-output pairs.

## Code Example: Fine-tuning a pre-trained LLM on a custom dataset (Python with Transformers)

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer, Trainer, TrainingArguments
from datasets import Dataset

# 1. Load the pre-trained model and tokenizer
model_name = "gpt2"  # Replace with the desired model name
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)

# 2. Prepare the dataset
def tokenize_function(examples):
    return tokenizer(examples["text"], padding="max_length", truncation=True, max_length=128) # Adjust max_length as needed

# Create a dummy dataset (replace with your actual dataset)
data = [{"text": "This is a sample sentence."}, {"text": "Another example sentence."}]
dataset = Dataset.from_dict({"text": [item["text"] for item in data]})
tokenized_dataset = dataset.map(tokenize_function, batched=True)

# 3. Define training arguments
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir="./results",
    per_device_train_batch_size=8,
    num_train_epochs=3,
    logging_dir="./logs",
    logging_steps=10,
    save_steps=100,
)

# 4. Create a Trainer
trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=tokenized_dataset,
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
)

# 5. Fine-tune the model
trainer.train()

# 6. Save the fine-tuned model
model.save_pretrained("./fine_tuned_model")
tokenizer.save_pretrained("./fine_tuned_model")
```

## Assignment

Fine-tune an LLM on a dataset of your choice (e.g., a dataset for question answering, text summarization, or code generation) and evaluate its performance. Compare the results to the pre-trained model.

## Interview Question

What are the key considerations when fine-tuning an LLM?

## Exercises
