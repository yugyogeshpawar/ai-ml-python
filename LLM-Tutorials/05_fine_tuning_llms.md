# 05 Fine-tuning LLMs

## Introduction

This tutorial covers the process of fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) to adapt them to specific tasks.

## What is Fine-tuning?

Fine-tuning is the process of taking a pre-trained LLM and further training it on a specific dataset to adapt it to a particular task or domain. This allows you to leverage the knowledge learned by the pre-trained model while tailoring it to your specific needs.

## Why Fine-tune LLMs?

*   **Improved Performance:** Fine-tuning can significantly improve the performance of an LLM on a specific task compared to using the pre-trained model directly.
*   **Domain Adaptation:** Fine-tuning allows you to adapt an LLM to a specific domain or style of writing.
*   **Task Specialization:** Fine-tuning enables you to specialize an LLM for tasks like question answering, text summarization, or code generation.

## Different Fine-tuning Techniques

There are two main approaches to fine-tuning:

*   **Full Fine-tuning:** This involves updating all the parameters of the LLM. While this can lead to the best performance, it is also the most computationally expensive approach.
*   **Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT):** This is a collection of techniques that focus on fine-tuning only a small subset of the model's parameters. This significantly reduces the computational cost and memory requirements. Some popular PEFT techniques include:
    *   **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation):** Instead of updating the large weight matrices of the model, LoRA adds smaller, trainable "adapter" matrices to the model's layers. This is like adding small, efficient "tuning knobs" to a large engine instead of rebuilding the whole thing.
    *   **Prefix Tuning:** This involves adding a small, trainable "prefix" to the input sequence. The model learns to adjust its behavior based on this prefix.
    *   **Prompt Tuning:** Similar to prefix tuning, but the "prompt" is a continuous vector that is optimized directly by the model.

|                     |      | Low memory usage.   |

## Data Preparation for Fine-tuning

The quality of your fine-tuning data is crucial for the success of your model. Here's a checklist for preparing your data:

*   **1. Dataset Selection:**
    *   Choose a dataset that is highly relevant to your target task (e.g., a dataset of question-answer pairs for a Q&A bot).
    *   Ensure the dataset is large enough to allow the model to learn the desired patterns.
*   **2. Data Cleaning:**
    *   Remove any irrelevant or noisy data.
    *   Correct any errors or inconsistencies in the data.
*   **3. Data Formatting:**
    *   Format the data into a consistent structure, typically input-output pairs. For example: `{"instruction": "Translate to French", "input": "Hello", "output": "Bonjour"}`.
    *   Ensure the formatting is compatible with the LLM and the fine-tuning library you are using.
*   **4. Data Splitting:**
    *   Split your data into training, validation, and test sets.
    *   The training set is used to train the model.
    *   The validation set is used to tune the model's hyperparameters.
    *   The test set is used to evaluate the final performance of the model.

## Code Example: Fine-tuning a pre-trained LLM on a custom dataset (Python with Transformers)

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer, Trainer, TrainingArguments
from datasets import Dataset

# 1. Load the pre-trained model and tokenizer
model_name = "gpt2"  # Replace with the desired model name
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)

# 2. Prepare the dataset
def tokenize_function(examples):
    return tokenizer(examples["text"], padding="max_length", truncation=True, max_length=128) # Adjust max_length as needed

# Create a dummy dataset (replace with your actual dataset)
data = [{"text": "This is a sample sentence."}, {"text": "Another example sentence."}]
dataset = Dataset.from_dict({"text": [item["text"] for item in data]})
tokenized_dataset = dataset.map(tokenize_function, batched=True)

# 3. Define training arguments
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir="./results",
    per_device_train_batch_size=8,
    num_train_epochs=3,
    logging_dir="./logs",
    logging_steps=10,
    save_steps=100,
)

# 4. Create a Trainer
trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=tokenized_dataset,
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
)

# 5. Fine-tune the model
trainer.train()

# 6. Save the fine-tuned model
model.save_pretrained("./fine_tuned_model")
tokenizer.save_pretrained("./fine_tuned_model")
```
