# 02 Open Source LLMs

## Introduction

This tutorial explores Open Source Large Language Models (LLMs), their advantages, disadvantages, and how to use them.

# Open Source LLMs

## Overview of Open Source LLMs

Open Source LLMs are language models whose code and weights are publicly available, allowing for community contributions, modifications, and redistribution. Examples include:

*   Llama (Meta)
*   Mistral (Mistral AI)
*   Falcon (Technology Innovation Institute)
*   Bloom (BigScience)

## Advantages of Open Source LLMs

*   **Transparency:** Code and model weights are open for inspection and auditing.
*   **Customization:** Models can be fine-tuned and adapted to specific tasks and datasets.
*   **Community Support:** Active communities provide resources, support, and updates.
*   **Cost-effective:** Often free to use and distribute.

## Disadvantages of Open Source LLMs

*   **Resource Intensive:** Training and fine-tuning can require significant computational resources.
*   **Model Quality:** Performance may vary compared to closed-source models, depending on the specific model and task.
*   **Licensing:** Understanding and adhering to the specific licenses (e.g., Apache 2.0, MIT) is crucial.

## How to Access and Use Open Source LLMs

*   **Hugging Face Hub:** A popular platform for accessing and sharing pre-trained models and datasets.
*   **Model APIs:** Some providers offer APIs for easy access to their models.
*   **Local Deployment:** Models can be downloaded and run locally on your hardware.

## Code Example: Using a pre-trained Open Source LLM for text generation (Python with Transformers)

```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Choose a model (e.g., a model from Hugging Face Hub)
model_name = "gpt2"  # Replace with the actual model name

# Create a text generation pipeline
generator = pipeline("text-generation", model=model_name)

# Generate text
prompt = "The meaning of life is"
output = generator(prompt, max_length=50, num_return_sequences=1)

# Print the generated text
print(output[0]["generated_text"])
```

## Assignment

Experiment with different Open Source LLMs and compare their performance on a specific task (e.g., text summarization, question answering, code generation). Document your findings, including the models used, the task, the evaluation metrics, and your conclusions.
