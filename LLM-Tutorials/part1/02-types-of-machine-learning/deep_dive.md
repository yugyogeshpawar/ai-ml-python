# Deep Dive: A Glimpse into the Algorithms

**Note:** This section is entirely optional. It provides a brief, high-level look at some of the actual algorithms used in each type of machine learning.

### 1. Supervised Learning Algorithms

There are two main types of supervised learning problems:
*   **Classification:** The goal is to predict a category (e.g., "Spam" or "Not Spam," "Cat" or "Dog").
*   **Regression:** The goal is to predict a continuous value (e.g., the price of a house, the temperature tomorrow).

**Common Algorithms:**
*   **Linear Regression:** The classic algorithm for regression problems. It tries to find a straight line that best fits the data points. For example, it might find that for every extra 100 sq. ft. in a house, the price increases by $20,000.
*   **Logistic Regression:** Despite its name, this is used for classification. It calculates the probability that an input belongs to a certain class. It's widely used in medical diagnosis and credit scoring.
*   **Support Vector Machines (SVMs):** A powerful classification algorithm that finds the "best line" or hyperplane that separates data into two classes. It tries to maximize the margin or distance between the classes, making it very robust.
*   **Decision Trees and Random Forests:** A Decision Tree asks a series of "if/then" questions to arrive at a decision. A Random Forest is a collection of many decision trees. By averaging the predictions of all the trees, it can make a more accurate and stable prediction. They are very popular because they are easy to interpret.

### 2. Unsupervised Learning Algorithms

The main goal here is to find structure in data.
*   **Clustering:** The goal is to group similar data points together.
*   **Dimensionality Reduction:** The goal is to reduce the number of variables (or "dimensions") in the data while preserving the important information.

**Common Algorithms:**
*   **K-Means Clustering:** This is the most famous clustering algorithm. You tell it how many clusters (`k`) you want to find, and it iteratively assigns each data point to the nearest cluster's center (or "centroid"). It's used for tasks like customer segmentation.
*   **Hierarchical Clustering:** This algorithm builds a tree of clusters. It can be "agglomerative" (starting with each point as its own cluster and merging them) or "divisive" (starting with one big cluster and splitting it).
*   **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** This is the most popular dimensionality reduction technique. It finds the "principal components," which are new, artificial dimensions that capture the most variance in the data. It's useful for visualizing high-dimensional data and for making supervised learning algorithms run faster.

### 3. Reinforcement Learning Concepts

Reinforcement Learning is less about specific, standalone algorithms and more about a framework of components that work together.

**Key Concepts:**
*   **Agent:** The learner or decision-maker (e.g., the AI playing a game).
*   **Environment:** The world the agent interacts with (e.g., the chessboard).
*   **State:** The current situation of the agent in the environment.
*   **Action:** A choice the agent can make.
*   **Reward:** The feedback from the environment. The agent's goal is to maximize the total cumulative reward over time.
*   **Policy (Ï€):** This is the "brain" of the agent. It's the strategy that the agent uses to choose an action based on the current state. The goal of training is to find the optimal policy.

**Common Algorithms:**
*   **Q-Learning:** A foundational RL algorithm. The "Q" stands for "Quality." The agent learns a "Q-value" for each state-action pair. This value represents the expected future reward of taking a certain action in a certain state. The agent then chooses the action with the highest Q-value.
*   **Deep Q-Networks (DQN):** This breakthrough algorithm, developed by DeepMind, combined Q-learning with deep neural networks. It allowed the agent to learn from high-dimensional inputs, like the raw pixels of an Atari game screen, and led to superhuman performance on many classic video games.
