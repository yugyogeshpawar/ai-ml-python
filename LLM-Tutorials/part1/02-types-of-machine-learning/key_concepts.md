# Key Concepts: Types of Machine Learning

Here are the most important terms from this lesson, explained in simple English.

### 1. Supervised Learning
-   **What it is:** Teaching an AI model by giving it examples that are already labeled with the correct answers.
-   **Key Idea:** The model learns to map inputs to outputs based on the "answer key" you provide.
-   **Analogy:** Using flashcards to study for a test. Each card has a question (the input) and the correct answer (the label).
-   **Use Case:** Predicting house prices. You show the model data for 1,000 houses where you already know the final selling price.

### 2. Unsupervised Learning
-   **What it is:** Asking the AI model to find hidden patterns or structures in data that has *not* been labeled.
-   **Key Idea:** The model explores the data and groups similar items together on its own.
-   **Analogy:** Sorting a big box of LEGO bricks by color and shape without being told what the categories should be. You just naturally group the similar pieces.
-   **Use Case:** Recommending a new song on Spotify. The system groups you with other listeners who have similar tastes and suggests a song they liked that you haven't heard.

### 3. Reinforcement Learning
-   **What it is:** Training an AI "agent" to make decisions by rewarding it for good choices and penalizing it for bad ones.
-   **Key Idea:** The model learns through trial and error to achieve a specific goal.
-   **Analogy:** Teaching a pet a new trick. You give it a treat (reward) when it does the right thing, encouraging it to repeat that action.
-   **Use Case:** An AI learning to play chess. It gets a positive reward for moves that lead to winning the game and a negative reward for moves that lead to losing.
