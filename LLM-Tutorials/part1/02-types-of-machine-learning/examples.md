# Examples in Action: Types of Machine Learning

Let's look at concrete examples for each of the three main "flavors" of Machine Learning.

### 1. Supervised Learning
*(Learning with a labeled "answer key")*

*   **Task: Medical Diagnosis**
    *   **Input Data:** A dataset of thousands of medical images (e.g., chest X-rays).
    *   **Labels (The "Answer Key"):** Each X-ray has been labeled by a human radiologist as either "Pneumonia" or "No Pneumonia."
    *   **Learning Process:** The model learns the visual patterns and features in the pixels that are associated with the "Pneumonia" label.
    *   **Result:** A new, unlabeled X-ray can be fed to the model, and it will predict the probability that the image contains pneumonia.

*   **Task: Credit Card Fraud Detection**
    *   **Input Data:** A massive history of credit card transactions.
    *   **Labels:** Each transaction has been labeled as either "Fraudulent" or "Not Fraudulent" (often based on whether the customer reported it as fraud).
    *   **Learning Process:** The model learns the patterns of fraudulent activity. These might be obvious (e.g., a transaction in a different country from the user's location) or very subtle (e.g., a series of small, unusual purchases).
    *   **Result:** When you make a new purchase, the model analyzes it in real-time and assigns a fraud risk score. If the score is too high, the transaction is flagged or blocked.

### 2. Unsupervised Learning
*(Finding hidden patterns in unlabeled data)*

*   **Task: Customer Segmentation for a Supermarket**
    *   **Input Data:** The purchase history of all customers (e.g., a list of every item each customer has bought over a year). There are no labels.
    *   **Learning Process:** The model is asked to find, for example, 5 distinct groups (clusters) of customers. It might identify groups like:
        1.  **"Health-Conscious Families":** Buy lots of fresh vegetables, organic products, and diapers.
        2.  **"Budget-Minded Students":** Buy instant noodles, store-brand items, and energy drinks.
        3.  **"Weekend Entertainers":** Buy expensive cheeses, wine, and snack foods, mostly on Fridays.
    *   **Result:** The supermarket can now send targeted promotions. The "Health-Conscious Families" get coupons for organic yogurt, while the "Budget-Minded Students" get a deal on pizza.

*   **Task: Discovering Topics in News Articles**
    *   **Input Data:** 10,000 news articles from the past week, with no labels.
    *   **Learning Process:** An unsupervised topic modeling algorithm (like Latent Dirichlet Allocation) analyzes the frequency and co-occurrence of words in the articles. It identifies clusters of words that tend to appear together.
    *   **Result:** The model might discover, for example, 3 main topics:
        1.  **Topic A:** "election, vote, candidate, poll, debate" (Politics)
        2.  **Topic B:** "market, stock, interest, rate, inflation" (Economics)
        3.  **Topic C:** "goal, team, score, match, season" (Sports)
    The model doesn't know the names "Politics" or "Sports," but it has successfully found the hidden structure in the data.

### 3. Reinforcement Learning
*(Learning through trial and error with rewards)*

*   **Task: Training a Robot to Vacuum a Room**
    *   **The Agent:** The robot vacuum.
    *   **The Environment:** A virtual simulation of a room with furniture and dust.
    *   **Actions:** The robot can move forward, turn left, turn right, or activate its suction.
    *   **Rewards and Penalties:**
        *   `+1` reward for every speck of dust it vacuums up.
        *   `-10` penalty for bumping into a wall or furniture.
        *   `-0.1` penalty for every second that passes (to encourage efficiency).
    *   **Learning Process:** At first, the robot moves randomly, bumping into things and getting negative rewards. Over millions of simulated trials, it gradually learns a **policy** (a strategy) that maximizes its total reward. It learns that moving in straight lines until it detects an obstacle is a good strategy, and that turning on its suction when it's over dust is highly rewarding.
    *   **Result:** A trained robot that can efficiently clean a room it has never seen before.

*   **Task: Optimizing a Power Grid**
    *   **The Agent:** An AI controller for the city's power grid.
    *   **The Environment:** The real-time supply (from power plants, solar, wind) and demand (from homes, businesses) of electricity.
    *   **Actions:** The agent can choose to draw more power from a certain plant, store excess energy in batteries, or buy power from a neighboring grid.
    *   **Rewards and Penalties:**
        *   Reward for meeting demand perfectly.
        *   Reward for using the cheapest energy sources (e.g., solar over expensive gas).
        *   Huge penalty for a blackout (failing to meet demand).
    *   **Learning Process:** The agent learns through simulation to find the optimal strategy for balancing the grid to minimize cost and prevent blackouts.
