# Key Concepts: AI, ML, and DL

Here are the most important terms from this lesson, explained in simple English.

### 1. Artificial Intelligence (AI)
-   **What it is:** The overall dream of creating smart computers that can perform tasks that usually require human intelligence.
-   **Analogy:** The entire toolbox. AI is the big category that contains all the different tools and approaches for making machines intelligent.
-   **Example:** A robot that can have a conversation with you, or a program that can diagnose diseases from medical scans.

### 2. Machine Learning (ML)
-   **What it is:** A specific way to achieve AI. Instead of writing step-by-step rules, you teach the computer by showing it lots of examples (data).
-   **Analogy:** A student learning for a test. You don't give them the exact answers; you give them practice problems and let them figure out the method. The more problems they solve, the better they get.
-   **Example:** Your email's spam filter. It learned to identify junk mail by looking at thousands of examples of spam and non-spam emails you've received.

### 3. Deep Learning (DL)
-   **What it is:** A very powerful and modern type of Machine Learning. It uses a structure called a "neural network" with many layers to learn very complex patterns from huge amounts of data.
-   **Analogy:** An expert detective. A regular detective might look at clues one by one. A deep learning detective can see how all the clues connect in very complex ways, finding patterns that nobody else would notice.
-   **Example:** AI assistants like Siri and Alexa understanding your commands, or AI art generators like Midjourney creating images from a text description. These are powered by Deep Learning.
