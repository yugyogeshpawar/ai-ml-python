# Try It Yourself: See AI in Action

You don't need to be a coder to interact with powerful AI models. These simple exercises will help you get a feel for how AI, ML, and DL work in the real world. All you need is your web browser.

### Exercise 1: Chat with a Large Language Model (LLM)

This is a direct experience with a **Deep Learning** model. These models are trained on a massive amount of text from the internet and can understand and generate human-like language.

1.  **Go to a free AI Chatbot:**
    *   [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) (requires a free account)
    *   [Claude](https://claude.ai/) (requires a free account)
    *   [Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/) (no account needed for basic use)

2.  **Ask it a question that requires reasoning.** Don't just ask for a fact. Try something like:
    *   "Explain the difference between AI, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning using an analogy of a chef in a kitchen."
    *   "Write a short poem about a robot who is learning to paint a sunset."
    *   "If I have a meeting at 2 PM, and it takes me 45 minutes to drive there, and I need 15 minutes to find parking, what is the latest I should leave my house?"

3.  **Observe the result.** Notice how the AI doesn't just pull a pre-written answer from a database. It *generates* the text word by word, based on the patterns it learned during its training. This is Deep Learning in action.

### Exercise 2: Use an Image Recognition Model

This exercise demonstrates **Machine Learning** (specifically, a model trained via Deep Learning) for a different task: understanding images.

1.  **Go to the Hugging Face "Image to Text" Space:**
    *   [Click here to open the tool](https://huggingface.co/spaces/nlpconnect/vit-gpt2-image-captioning)

2.  **Find a picture on your computer.** It could be a photo of your pet, your lunch, a landscape, or a car.

3.  **Upload the image.** You can either drag and drop the file or click to upload.

4.  **Look at the output.** The model will generate a text description of the image.
    *   How accurate is it?
    *   Did it get the main subject right?
    *   Did it miss any important details or misinterpret something?

5.  **Think about it:** This model was trained on millions of images with captions. It learned the patterns connecting pixels in an image to words in a sentence. You are seeing the result of that training. When it makes a mistake, it's often because it saw something in your photo that resembles a different pattern it learned. For example, it might mistake a brown, fluffy dog for a teddy bear if it has seen many pictures of both.
