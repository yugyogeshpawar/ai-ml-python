# Try It Yourself: Brainstorming AI's Impact

This exercise is a thought experiment to get you thinking critically and creatively about the future impact of AI on a specific profession.

---

### The Scenario

Your task is to analyze how AI might change a specific job. You will use an AI chatbot as a brainstorming partner to explore both the potential positive and negative impacts.

### Exercise: Analyzing the Future of a Job

1.  **Pick a profession.** Choose a job you are familiar with or curious about. It could be your own job, or something else entirely.
    *   *Examples:* Teacher, graphic designer, lawyer, doctor, musician, journalist, plumber, software developer.

2.  **Go to your favorite chatbot.**

3.  **Start with a broad prompt to explore task automation.**
    > I want to analyze the future impact of AI on the job of a **[Your Chosen Profession]**.
    >
    > First, break down the job of a **[Your Chosen Profession]** into its 5-7 most important daily or weekly tasks.

4.  **Analyze the list of tasks.** The AI should give you a good breakdown of the role. Now, let's think about which of these tasks are ripe for automation or augmentation.

5.  **Ask a follow-up prompt about augmentation (the positive case).**
    > That's a helpful list. Now, for each of those tasks, describe how a powerful AI assistant could **augment** or **help** a human professional perform that task better, faster, or more effectively. Frame this in a positive light.

6.  **Analyze the "utopian" vision.** This response should paint a picture of how AI can act as a powerful tool, freeing up the human professional from tedious work and allowing them to focus on the most important, high-level aspects of their job.

7.  **Now, ask a follow-up prompt about automation (the challenging case).**
    > Thank you. Now, let's consider the opposite. For each of those same tasks, describe how AI could **automate** that task to the point where human involvement is significantly reduced or no longer necessary. Frame this in a more disruptive light.

8.  **Analyze the "dystopian" vision.** This response should make you think about the real challenges of job displacement. It will highlight the parts of the job that are most vulnerable to being replaced by sophisticated AI systems.

**Reflection:**
By going through this exercise, you have engaged in a balanced and critical analysis of AI's impact.
*   You've seen that a "job" is not a single thing, but a **bundle of tasks**.
*   You've identified that some of these tasks are more susceptible to automation than others.
*   You've explored both the **augmentation** (AI as a helpful tool) and **automation** (AI as a replacement) narratives.

The real future will likely be a complex mix of these two visions. The professionals who thrive will be those who embrace the augmentation opportunities and adapt their skills to focus on the tasks that remain uniquely human: critical thinking, creativity, empathy, and strategic decision-making.
