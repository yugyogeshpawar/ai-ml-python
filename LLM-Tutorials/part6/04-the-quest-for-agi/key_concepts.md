# Key Concepts: The Quest for AGI

Here are the key terms for understanding the future-facing goal of Artificial General Intelligence.

### 1. Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI)
-   **What it is:** AI that is specialized for a specific task or a limited range of tasks. **All AI systems in existence today are Narrow AI.**
-   **Analogy:** A pocket calculator. It is superhuman at its one specific task (arithmetic), but it can't write a poem, recognize a face, or drive a car.
-   **Why it matters:** It's important to recognize that even the most powerful LLMs today are still technically "narrow." Their task is to be next-token predictors, and while that one skill gives them incredible versatility, it is not the same as general intelligence.

### 2. Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)
-   **What it is:** A hypothetical form of AI that possesses the ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge across a wide range of tasks at a level comparable to a human being.
-   **Analogy:** The character Data from Star Trek. He is not designed for a single purpose; he can learn, reason, and adapt to solve virtually any problem he encounters, from piloting a starship to analyzing a piece of music.
-   **Why it matters:** AGI is the long-term, aspirational goal for many researchers in the field. Its creation would be one of the most significant events in human history, with profound and unpredictable consequences for society.

### 3. The Alignment Problem
-   **What it is:** The challenge of ensuring that the goals and behaviors of a highly intelligent AI system are aligned with human values and intentions.
-   **Analogy:** The story of King Midas. He wished for everything he touched to turn to gold (**Goal**). He got exactly what he asked for, but it was not what he truly *wanted*, leading to disastrous consequences (he couldn't eat, and he turned his daughter to gold). The Alignment Problem is the challenge of ensuring that when we ask an AGI for "human flourishing," it doesn't interpret that in a literal, unforeseen, and catastrophic way.
-   **Why it matters:** As AI systems become more autonomous and powerful, ensuring they are safe and beneficial becomes the most important problem to solve. A superintelligent system that is not aligned with our values could be extremely dangerous.
