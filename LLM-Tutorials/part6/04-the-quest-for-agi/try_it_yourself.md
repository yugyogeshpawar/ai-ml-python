# Try It Yourself: Debating the Future of AI

This final exercise is a written one. It's designed to help you synthesize the concepts you've learned throughout this tutorial and form your own informed opinion on the future of AI.

There are no right or wrong answers here. The goal is to think critically and articulate your own perspective.

---

### The Scenario

You will engage with the central debate about the future of AI: are we on the cusp of a new era of intelligence, or are we just getting better at creating sophisticated parrots? You will use an AI chatbot to help you explore both sides of the argument before forming your own conclusion.

### Exercise: The AGI Debate

1.  **Go to your favorite chatbot.**

2.  **Prompt the AI to be your debate partner.** We will ask it to take on the role of two different experts.
    > I want you to help me explore the debate around Artificial General Intelligence.
    >
    > First, act as **Expert A**, a strong believer that scaling up current Large Language Models will lead directly to AGI in the near future. Please write a short, passionate argument (2-3 paragraphs) from this perspective, explaining why you believe this is the case.
    >
    > Second, act as **Expert B**, a skeptic who believes that current LLMs are fundamentally missing key ingredients for true intelligence and that AGI is either impossible or very far away. Please write a short, passionate argument (2-3 paragraphs) from this perspective.

3.  **Analyze the arguments.** Read the two perspectives the AI has generated.
    *   What are the key points of the "optimist" (Expert A)? They will likely focus on emergent abilities, scaling laws, and the surprising reasoning capabilities of modern models.
    *   What are the key points of the "skeptic" (Expert B)? They will likely focus on the lack of true understanding, grounding in the physical world, common-sense reasoning, and the problem of hallucination.

4.  **Write Your Own Opinion.** Now it's your turn. Based on everything you have learned in this tutorial and the arguments you've just read, write a short essay (3-5 paragraphs) outlining your own position.
    *   Start by briefly summarizing the two opposing viewpoints.
    *   State your own opinion. Do you lean more toward the optimist, the skeptic, or somewhere in the middle?
    *   Justify your position. Refer back to the concepts you've learned. Does the power of the Transformer's attention mechanism convince you? Does the problem of AI bias make you skeptical? Does the existence of AI agents suggest a path toward autonomy?
    *   Conclude with your thoughts on the most important ethical considerations or societal challenges we need to address as this technology continues to develop.

**Reflection:**
Congratulations! You have just engaged in one of the most important intellectual conversations of the 21st century. By articulating your own informed opinion, you have moved from being a passive observer of AI to an active and thoughtful participant in the conversation about its future.

This is the ultimate goal of this tutorial: not just to teach you what an LLM is, but to empower you with the conceptual vocabulary to think critically, ask the right questions, and help shape the development of this transformative technology for the better.
