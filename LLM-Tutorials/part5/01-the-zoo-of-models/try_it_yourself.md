# Try It Yourself: Comparing the "Personalities" of Different Models

The best way to understand the differences between the major models is to talk to them. This exercise will guide you through asking the same question to different "brains" and observing the subtle but important differences in their responses.

### The Scenario

You will act as a user asking for creative advice. The goal is to see how the different model "families" approach the same open-ended, creative task.

### Your Toolkit of Models

For this exercise, you will need to open a few tabs in your browser:

1.  **Team OpenAI (GPT):** Open [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/).
2.  **Team Anthropic (Claude):** Open [Claude.ai](https://claude.ai/).
3.  **Team Google (Gemini):** Open [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/).
4.  **(Optional) Team Open Source (Llama):** If you want to try an open-source model, you can use the Llama 3 model on [Hugging Face Chat](https://huggingface.co/chat/).

### Exercise: The Creative Challenge

You are going to give the exact same prompt to at least two (and preferably three or four) of the models listed above.

**The Prompt:**

> I'm a writer experiencing writer's block. I need to write a short story, but I have no ideas. My story needs to involve three elements:
> 1.  An old, forgotten library
> 2.  A mysterious, locked box
> 3.  A character who can talk to ghosts
>
> Please brainstorm three distinct story ideas for me. For each idea, provide a title, a one-paragraph summary, and a suggestion for the first sentence.

### What to Look For: A Comparison Checklist

After you get the responses from each model, compare them. Don't just look at which one is "best," but try to identify the *character* of the response.

1.  **Creativity and Originality:**
    *   Did the model give you generic, predictable ideas (e.g., the ghost is trapped in the box)?
    *   Or did it come up with a surprising twist or a unique angle on the prompt? Which model was the most "out of the box"?

2.  **Structure and Formatting:**
    *   Did the model follow your formatting instructions perfectly (three ideas, title, summary, first sentence)?
    *   Was the response well-organized and easy to read?

3.  **Tone and "Personality":**
    *   Read the responses out loud. Do they have a different feel?
    *   Is one more formal and academic? Is another more conversational and friendly? Does one feel more like a creative partner (e.g., using phrases like "How about this..." or "We could explore...")? This is often where users notice a big difference between Claude and other models.

4.  **Helpfulness and Going the Extra Mile:**
    *   Did any model add extra, helpful suggestions that you didn't explicitly ask for? (e.g., "You could also think about the ghost's personality..." or "Here are some questions to get you started.")
    *   Sometimes, models like Gemini, with their connection to search, might try to ground their ideas in existing literary tropes.

**Reflection:**
There is no single "best" model for all tasks. By running this comparison, you'll start to develop an intuition for their different strengths. You might find that you prefer GPT for complex reasoning, Claude for creative writing, and Gemini for tasks that require up-to-date information. An expert AI user doesn't just use one tool; they know which tool is right for the job.
