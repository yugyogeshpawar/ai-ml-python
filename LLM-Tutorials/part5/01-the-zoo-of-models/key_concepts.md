# Key Concepts: The Zoo of Models

Here are the key terms for understanding the landscape of different LLM providers.

### 1. Closed Source Model
-   **What it is:** A proprietary model whose inner workings, code, and weights are kept secret by the company that created it.
-   **Analogy:** A secret family recipe. You can eat the delicious food at the family's restaurant (use the API), but they will never tell you the exact ingredients or cooking method.
-   **Why it matters:** These models (like GPT-4 and Claude 3) are often the most powerful and are easy to access through polished products and APIs. However, you have limited control over them, and they can be more expensive.
-   **Examples:** OpenAI's GPT series, Anthropic's Claude series, Google's Gemini series.

### 2. Open Source Model
-   **What it is:** A model whose weights and, often, training code are publicly released, allowing anyone to download, modify, and run them on their own hardware. (Note: The term is used loosely; "openly available" is often more accurate as some licenses have restrictions).
-   **Analogy:** A public recipe from a famous chef. Anyone can take the recipe, cook it at home, and even tweak the ingredients to their liking.
-   **Why it matters:** Open source models have fueled a massive wave of innovation, allowing researchers and developers to build on top of powerful base models without needing the billions of dollars required for initial training. They offer greater transparency and control.
-   **Examples:** Meta's Llama series, Mistral's models, Falcon.

### 3. Multimodality
-   **What it is:** The ability of an AI model to understand and process information from multiple different types of data (or "modalities") at the same time.
-   **Analogy:** Human senses. Humans don't just understand text; we understand the world through sight, sound, and language all at once. A multimodal AI is moving closer to this ability.
-   **Why it matters:** This is the next frontier of AI. Instead of just a chatbot, you have an AI that can look at a picture, listen to a question about it, and give a spoken answer. It allows for much more natural and powerful human-computer interaction.
-   **Examples:** GPT-4o (omni), Gemini.
