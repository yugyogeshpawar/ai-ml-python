# Try It Yourself: "Seeing" the Experts at Work

It's impossible to truly "see" the internal routing of an MoE model without specialized visualization tools. However, we can design a prompt that encourages the model to "externalize" the kind of thinking that an MoE architecture facilitates.

---

### The Scenario

We will give a model a prompt that contains two very different and specialized questions in the same request. A dense model has to use its entire "brain" to process both, while an MoE model could theoretically use different experts for each part of the prompt. We will use a prompt to simulate this expert routing.

### Exercise: The "Two Experts" Prompt

1.  **Go to a powerful, modern chatbot.** A model like GPT-4o, Claude 3 Opus, or Gemini is best for this, as they have the reasoning capacity to handle this kind of meta-instructional prompt.

2.  **Craft a prompt that asks the AI to simulate an MoE system.**
    > You are a large language model with a Mixture of Experts architecture. Two of your experts are:
    > 1.  **Expert_Code:** A specialist in writing Python code.
    > 2.  **Expert_Poetry:** A specialist in 17th-century English poetry.
    >
    > I will give you a two-part task. For each part, please first state which expert you would route the task to, and then generate the response using that expert's specialized knowledge.
    >
    > ---
    >
    > **Task 1:** Write a simple Python function to check if a number is prime.
    >
    > **Task 2:** Write a four-line poem about the changing of the seasons in the style of John Donne.

3.  **Analyze the response.** The model should follow your instructions and produce an output that looks something like this:

    > **Task 1: Write a simple Python function to check if a number is prime.**
    >
    > **Routing to: Expert_Code**
    >
    > ```python
    > def is_prime(n):
    >   """Checks if a number is prime."""
    >   if n <= 1:
    >     return False
    >   for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
    >     if n % i == 0:
    >       return False
    >   return True
    > ```
    >
    > ---
    >
    > **Task 2: Write a four-line poem about the changing of the seasons in the style of John Donne.**
    >
    > **Routing to: Expert_Poetry**
    >
    > As Summer's fiery reign doth fade and die,
    > So Autumn's chill doth claim the waiting wood;
    > A verdant world prepares to say goodbye,
    > To sleep in frost, as all things mortal should.

**Reflection:**
This exercise simulates the core idea of MoE.
*   **The Router:** Your prompt forced the AI to perform the "routing" step explicitly, identifying which expert was best for each task.
*   **The Experts:** The AI then adopted the persona of each expert to generate the output. The code it generated is logical and technical, while the poem uses the archaic language and metaphysical tone characteristic of John Donne.

While the underlying model might be dense or MoE, this prompting technique forces it to behave *as if* it has specialized experts. This demonstrates the efficiency of the concept: why use a poet to write code, or a coder to write poetry? MoE architectures build this efficient routing system directly into the model's structure, allowing it to scale to massive sizes while keeping inference costs manageable.
