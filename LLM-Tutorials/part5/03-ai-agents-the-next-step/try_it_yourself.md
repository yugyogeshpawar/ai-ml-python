# Try It Yourself: "Be the Agent"

Building a true AI agent is a complex programming task. However, you can simulate the ReAct (Reason-Act) loop yourself using a standard chatbot to get a feel for how an agent "thinks."

In this exercise, you will manually execute the steps of an agent to solve a multi-step problem. You will provide the reasoning, and the chatbot will provide the tool use.

### The Scenario

**Your Goal:** Plan a day trip from San Francisco to Napa Valley. You need to figure out the driving time, find a highly-rated place for lunch, and find one interesting activity to do in the afternoon.

**Your Tools (The Chatbot's Abilities):**
1.  A web search tool (to look up information).
2.  A calculator (for any math).

### Exercise: The Manual ReAct Loop

You will have a conversation with your favorite chatbot (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.).

**Step 1: Initial Goal**

*   Start a new chat and set up the scenario for the AI.
    > **You are a helpful assistant with access to a web search tool. We are going to plan a day trip together. I will provide the reasoning, and you will perform the actions (tool use).**
    >
    > **Our Goal:** Plan a day trip from San Francisco to Napa Valley.

The AI will likely respond with "Okay, I'm ready!"

**Step 2: First Loop (Reason -> Act -> Observe)**

*   **Your Reasoning:** Now, you perform the "Reason" step yourself. Think about the very first thing you need to know.
    > **My Thought:** The first thing I need to figure out is how long it takes to drive from San Francisco to Napa.
    >
    > **Action:** Please use your web search tool to find the typical driving time.

*   **AI's Action and Observation:** The chatbot will now use its web search ability and give you a response.
    > **AI's likely response:** "The typical driving time from San Francisco to Napa Valley is about 1.5 to 2 hours, depending on traffic."

---

**Step 3: Second Loop (Reason -> Act -> Observe)**

*   **Your Reasoning:** You now have the first piece of information. Time for the next step.
    > **My Thought:** Okay, the drive is about 2 hours each way, so that's 4 hours of driving total. That's reasonable for a day trip. Now I need to find a good place for lunch. I want a place that is highly rated but not too expensive.
    >
    > **Action:** Please use your web search tool to find "best casual lunch restaurants in Napa Valley with high ratings."

*   **AI's Action and Observation:** The chatbot will search and provide a list of restaurants.
    > **AI's likely response:** "Some highly-rated casual lunch spots in Napa include Gott's Roadside, Oakville Grocery, and Oxbow Public Market..."

---

**Step 4: Third Loop (Reason -> Act -> Observe)**

*   **Your Reasoning:** You have a lunch spot. Now for the afternoon activity.
    > **My Thought:** Gott's Roadside sounds good. After lunch, I'll want to do an activity. A wine tasting tour seems like a classic Napa activity.
    >
    > **Action:** Please use your web search tool to find "best winery tours for beginners near Yountville, Napa" (since Gott's is there).

*   **AI's Action and Observation:** The chatbot will search and provide a list of wineries.
    > **AI's likely response:** "Some popular wineries for beginners near Yountville include Domaine Chandon for sparkling wine, Robert Mondavi for its history, and V. Sattui for its large tasting room and deli..."

**Step 5: Final Synthesis**

*   **Your Reasoning:** You now have all the pieces.
    > **My Thought:** I have all the information I need.
    >
    > **Action:** Please summarize our plan into a simple itinerary.

*   **AI's Final Output:** The chatbot will now synthesize all the information from the conversation into a final plan.

**Reflection:**
You have just walked through the exact same logical process an AI agent would. You provided the high-level reasoning and planning, and the AI acted as the "tool." An autonomous agent simply automates the "My Thought" part, using the LLM to generate the reasoning steps itself. This exercise should make it clear how the ReAct framework allows a system to break a big, fuzzy goal into a series of concrete, solvable steps.
