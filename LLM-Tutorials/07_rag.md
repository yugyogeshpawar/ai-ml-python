# 07 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

## Introduction

Large Language Models (LLMs) have a knowledge cutoff, meaning they don't know about events that have happened since they were trained. They also can't access private or proprietary information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that addresses these limitations by allowing LLMs to access external knowledge sources.

## What is RAG?

RAG is a technique that combines a retrieval system with a generative model. Here's how it works:

1.  **Retrieval:** When a user provides a prompt, the retrieval system searches a knowledge source (e.g., a collection of documents, a database, or a search engine) for relevant information.
2.  **Augmentation:** The retrieved information is then added to the user's original prompt.
3.  **Generation:** The augmented prompt is then fed to the LLM, which uses the retrieved information to generate a more accurate and contextually relevant response.

## Why Use RAG?

*   **Access to Up-to-Date Information:** RAG allows LLMs to access the latest information from external knowledge sources.
*   **Access to Private Data:** RAG can be used to allow LLMs to access private or proprietary information without needing to be retrained.
*   **Reduced Hallucinations:** By grounding the LLM's response in retrieved information, RAG can help to reduce the likelihood of the model "hallucinating" or making up facts.
*   **Improved Transparency:** RAG can provide users with the sources of the information used to generate a response, which improves transparency and trust.

                                                   |   Response  |
                                                   +-------------+

## Key Components of a RAG System

*   **Knowledge Source:** A collection of documents, a database, or a search engine that contains the information you want to make available to the LLM.
*   **Document Chunker:** A tool that breaks down large documents into smaller, more manageable chunks.
*   **Embedding Model:** A model that converts text into numerical representations (embeddings).
*   **Vector Database:** A database that is optimized for storing and searching for embeddings.
*   **Retrieval System:** A system that takes a user's prompt, converts it to an embedding, and then searches the vector database for the most similar embeddings.
*   **LLM:** A large language model that generates a response based on the augmented prompt.

## Assignment

Build a simple RAG system that can answer questions about a specific document. You can use a library like LangChain or LlamaIndex to help you with this.

## Interview Question
