# Deep Dive: The Transformer Architecture Unpacked

**Note:** This optional section provides a more detailed, but still conceptual, overview of the components inside a Transformer block.

---

The Transformer architecture is composed of a stack of identical "blocks." A model like GPT-3 might have 96 of these blocks stacked on top of each other. Each block contains two main sub-layers:

1.  **The Multi-Head Self-Attention Layer**
2.  **The Feed-Forward Neural Network**

Let's briefly look at each one.

### 1. Multi-Head Self-Attention

This is the heart of the Transformer. We've already learned the core concept of "attention," but the "Multi-Head" part is also a key innovation.

Instead of just having one attention mechanism, the Transformer has many of them working in parallel. Each of these is called an "attention head."

> **Analogy: A Team of Specialist Detectives**
>
> Imagine you have a team of detectives (the attention heads) all looking at the same sentence. Each detective has been trained to look for a different *type* of relationship.
> *   **Head 1** might be a grammar expert, focusing on subject-verb relationships.
> *   **Head 2** might be a pronoun specialist, focusing on resolving what "it" or "they" refers to.
> *   **Head 3** might look for causal relationships ("A happened *because* of B").
> *   **Head 4** might look for location-based relationships ("the book on the *table*").
>
> Each head independently scans the sentence and produces its own set of attention scores. The Transformer then combines the findings from all these specialist heads to build a much more robust and nuanced understanding of the text than any single head could achieve on its own.

**How it technically works (The Q, K, V vectors):**
For each token, the model generates three vectors from its embedding:
*   **Query (Q):** "I am a token, and this is what I am looking for."
*   **Key (K):** "I am a token, and this is the kind of information I have."
*   **Value (V):** "I am a token, and this is the actual content/meaning I hold."

To calculate the attention score for a given token, its **Query** vector is compared to the **Key** vector of every other token in the sentence. This comparison (a dot product) determines how "relevant" they are to each other. These scores are then used to create a weighted sum of all the **Value** vectors, which produces the final, contextualized output for that token.

### 2. The Feed-Forward Network (FFN)

After the attention layer has done its work of gathering context from around the sentence, the output for each token is passed to the second sub-layer: a simple Feed-Forward Network.

> **What it is:** This is a standard, classic neural network. Each token's vector is processed independently by the FFN.

**Its purpose is to "think" about the information gathered by the attention layer.** You can think of the attention layer as the "information gathering" step and the FFN as the "information processing" step. It adds more computational depth, allowing the model to learn more complex patterns based on the contextualized vectors.

### Putting It All Together: The Full Block

A single Transformer block works like this for every token:

1.  **Self-Attention:** The token looks at all the other tokens in the sentence (using multiple attention heads) to gather context. This produces a new, context-rich vector.
2.  **Add & Norm:** The output of the attention layer is added to the original input vector (this is a "residual connection," which helps with training) and then normalized.
3.  **Feed-Forward Network:** The resulting vector is passed through the FFN for deeper processing.
4.  **Add & Norm:** This output is again added to the vector that went *into* the FFN and normalized.

The final vector from this block is then passed on as the input to the *next* Transformer block in the stack, where the whole process repeats. By the time a token has passed through all 96 blocks, its embedding has been progressively enriched with layer after layer of contextual information, allowing the model to generate incredibly coherent and relevant output.
