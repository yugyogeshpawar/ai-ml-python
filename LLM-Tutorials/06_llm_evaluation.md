# 06 Evaluating Large Language Models

## Introduction

Once you have a trained or fine-tuned LLM, how do you know if it's any good? This tutorial covers the essential methods for evaluating the performance of LLMs.

## Why is Evaluation Important?

Evaluation is crucial for:

*   **Assessing Model Quality:** Objectively measuring the performance of your model.
*   **Comparing Models:** Choosing the best model for a specific task.
*   **Identifying Weaknesses:** Understanding where your model is failing so you can improve it.
*   **Ensuring Safety and Fairness:** Detecting and mitigating biases and harmful outputs.

## Automated Metrics

Automated metrics are used to evaluate LLMs on specific tasks by comparing the model's output to a reference output. Some common metrics include:

*   **BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy):** Commonly used for machine translation, it measures the overlap of n-grams (sequences of n words) between the model's output and a reference translation.
*   **ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation):** Commonly used for text summarization, it measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and word pairs between the model's output and a reference summary.
*   **Perplexity:** Measures how well a probability model predicts a sample. A lower perplexity score indicates that the model is better at predicting the sample text.

## Human Evaluation

While automated metrics are useful, they don't always capture the full picture of a model's performance. Human evaluation is often necessary to assess factors like:

*   **Fluency:** Is the generated text grammatically correct and easy to read?
*   **Coherence:** Does the generated text make sense and flow logically?
*   **Relevance:** Is the generated text relevant to the prompt or task?
*   **Helpfulness:** Does the generated text actually help the user?
*   **Safety:** Is the generated text free of harmful, biased, or inappropriate content?

## Benchmarks

Benchmarks are standardized datasets and tasks that are used to evaluate and compare the performance of different LLMs. Some popular benchmarks include:

*   **GLUE (General Language Understanding Evaluation):** A collection of nine tasks for evaluating the natural language understanding capabilities of models.
*   **SuperGLUE:** A more challenging version of GLUE with more difficult tasks.
*   **MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding):** A benchmark that measures a model's multitask accuracy across a wide range of subjects.

## Assignment

Choose an LLM and evaluate its performance on a specific task using both an automated metric and human evaluation. Compare the results and discuss the pros and cons of each evaluation method.

## Interview Question

What are the limitations of automated metrics for evaluating LLMs?

## Exercises

1.  **Explain Evaluation Methods:** Describe the difference between automated metrics and human evaluation.
2.  **Research Benchmarks:** Choose one of the benchmarks mentioned above and describe the tasks it includes.
3.  **Human Evaluation Design:** Design a human evaluation study to assess the quality of a chatbot. What criteria would you use?
4.  **Perplexity Explained:** In your own words, explain what perplexity measures and why a lower score is better.
