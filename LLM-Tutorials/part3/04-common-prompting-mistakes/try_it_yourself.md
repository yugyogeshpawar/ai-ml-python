# Try It Yourself: Debugging Bad Prompts

This exercise will challenge you to act as a "prompt debugger." You will be given several examples of flawed prompts. Your job is to identify the mistake and rewrite the prompt to be more effective.

### How to Do This Exercise

For each scenario below, do the following:
1.  Read the "Bad Prompt."
2.  Identify which of the common mistakes it's making (Vagueness, Missing Context, etc.).
3.  Rewrite it into a "Good Prompt" using the techniques you've learned.
4.  (Optional) Try both the bad and good prompts in your favorite chatbot to see the difference in the quality of the response.

### Scenario 1: The Book Recommendation

*   **Goal:** Get a good book recommendation.
*   **Bad Prompt:**
    > "Recommend a book for me to read."

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **What's the mistake?** This is extremely vague and has no context. The AI has no idea what you like.
*   **Your "Good Prompt":**
    > *(Rewrite the prompt here. Think about what context is needed. What books have you liked in the past? What genres do you enjoy? What kind of mood are you in?)*

### Scenario 2: The Email Draft

*   **Goal:** Draft an email to a coworker.
*   **Bad Prompt:**
    > "Write an email to Bob about the report. Tell him it's late."

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **What's the mistake?** This is missing crucial context and is a bit ambiguous. What report? How late is it? What is the desired tone (apologetic, formal, informal)? Who is Bob?
*   **Your "Good Prompt":**
    > *(Rewrite the prompt. Give the AI a role. Provide the necessary context about the report and the reason for the delay. Specify the tone and any key points that must be included.)*

### Scenario 3: The Fact-Finding Mission

*   **Goal:** Learn about a historical event for a school project.
*   **Bad Prompt:**
    > "What caused the fall of the Roman Empire? Give me all the details."

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **What's the mistake?** This is a huge, complex topic. Asking for "all the details" is a recipe for a long, unfocused, and potentially overwhelming response. It's also prone to hallucination because of the vast scope.
*   **Your "Good Prompt":**
    > *(Rewrite the prompt to be more specific. Ask for a summary of the main theories. Ask for the output in a specific format that would be useful for a school project, like a bulleted list or a short summary for each theory.)*

### Scenario 4: The Confusing Request

*   **Goal:** Get a list of activities for a team-building event.
*   **Bad Prompt:**
    > "Don't give me any team-building ideas that aren't unsuitable for a non-remote team that doesn't dislike outdoor activities."

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **What's the mistake?** This is a mess of double and triple negatives. It's very hard for a human to parse, let alone an AI.
*   **Your "Good Prompt":**
    > *(Rewrite the prompt using simple, positive, and direct language.)*

**Reflection:**
By practicing how to spot and fix bad prompts, you are training yourself to think like a prompt engineer. You'll start to automatically provide the right level of detail and clarity in your own requests, leading to much better results from your AI assistant.
