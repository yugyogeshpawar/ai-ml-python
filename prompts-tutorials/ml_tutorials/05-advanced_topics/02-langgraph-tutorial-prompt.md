# Prompt: Building Stateful AI Agents with LangGraph

### 1. Title
Generate a tutorial titled: **"Beyond Chains: Building Multi-Agent Systems with LangGraph"**

### 2. Objective
To teach developers how to build complex, stateful, and cyclical AI applications using LangGraph. The tutorial will move beyond linear chains to demonstrate how to construct multi-agent systems that can collaborate to solve problems.

### 3. Target Audience
*   Developers already comfortable with LangChain fundamentals (LCEL, Agents).
*   AI engineers looking to build more robust and sophisticated agentic systems.
*   Anyone interested in the future of autonomous AI systems.

### 4. Prerequisites
*   Solid experience with LangChain, including building basic agents and using tools.
*   Strong Python skills, including a good understanding of `TypedDict` for state management.

### 5. Key Concepts Covered
*   **The "Why" of LangGraph:** Understanding the limitations of linear chains (DAGs) and the need for graphs with cycles.
*   **Graph State:** Defining a shared state object that all nodes in the graph can read from and write to.
*   **Nodes and Edges:** Defining nodes as functions and connecting them with edges to create a computation graph.
*   **Conditional Edges:** The core of LangGraph's powerâ€”routing logic that decides which node to run next based on the current state.
*   **Multi-Agent Collaboration:** Architecting systems where different agents (represented as nodes) can pass work to each other.
*   **Human-in-the-Loop:** How to build graphs that can pause and wait for human feedback before proceeding.

### 6. Open-Source Tools & Libraries
*   **Python 3.x**
*   **LangChain (`langchain`, `langchain-openai`, etc.)**
*   **LangGraph**
*   **Tavily Search API or similar:** For a high-quality web search tool.

### 7. Datasets
*   No dataset is required. The project is agent-based and will interact with live web search tools.

### 8. Step-by-Step Tutorial Structure

**Part 1: From Chains to Graphs**
*   **1.1 The Limits of Chains:** Start by explaining that standard LangChain agents are Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), meaning they can't easily loop or have complex conditional logic.
*   **1.2 Introducing LangGraph:** Position LangGraph as the solution for building stateful applications with cycles. Use a flowchart analogy.
*   **1.3 The Core Components:**
    *   **State:** Define a `TypedDict` to represent the shared state of the graph.
    *   **Nodes:** Show how a simple Python function can be a node.
    *   **Edges:** Explain how to connect nodes.

**Part 2: Project - A Multi-Agent Research Team**
*   **2.1 The Goal:** Build a hierarchical team of AI agents to write a research report on a given topic. The team consists of:
    *   A **"Chief" Agent:** The project manager. It plans the research, delegates tasks, and synthesizes the final report.
    *   Two **"Worker" Agents:** Specialists that execute tasks. One is a "Web Researcher," and the other is a "Data Analyst."
*   **2.2 Defining the Graph State:**
    *   Create a `TypedDict` state that includes fields for the research topic, sub-tasks, worker findings, and the final report.
*   **2.3 Creating the Agent Nodes:**
    *   Implement each agent as a separate function (a node).
    *   The "Chief" node will take the topic and generate a list of sub-tasks.
    *   The "Worker" nodes will take a sub-task and use a tool (e.g., web search) to execute it, returning their findings.
*   **2.4 Defining the Edges and Logic:**
    *   **Entry Point:** The graph starts at the "Chief" agent.
    *   **Conditional Edge:** After the Chief creates the plan, a conditional edge routes the flow to the worker agents. This edge will decide which worker gets which task.
    *   **Looping:** The graph will loop through the worker nodes until all sub-tasks are complete.
    *   **Final Node:** Once all workers are done, the graph routes back to the Chief agent to synthesize the final report.
*   **2.5 Compiling and Running the Graph:**
    *   Show how to add all the nodes and edges to a `StatefulGraph`.
    *   Compile the graph and invoke it with a research topic.
    *   Print the final state to show the completed report.

**Part 3: Adding Human-in-the-Loop Supervision**
*   **3.1 The Need for Oversight:** Explain that for critical tasks, we might want a human to approve the agent's plan.
*   **3.2 Implementation:**
    *   Add a special "human_approval" node to the graph.
    *   After the Chief agent creates its plan, the graph will route to this node.
    *   The graph will pause at this node, print the plan, and wait for user input (`"yes"` or `"no"`) from the command line.
    *   A conditional edge will either continue to the worker agents or end the process based on the human's feedback.

**Part 4: Conclusion**
*   Recap how LangGraph enabled the creation of a complex, cyclical, multi-agent system that would be very difficult to build with standard chains.
*   Discuss other potential applications for LangGraph, such as self-correcting code generation or dynamic user support workflows.

### 9. Tone and Style
*   **Tone:** Architectural, conceptual, and forward-looking.
*   **Style:** Focus on graph-based thinking. Use diagrams heavily to illustrate the flow of state and control. The code should be well-structured, with clear separation between state, nodes, and graph definition.
