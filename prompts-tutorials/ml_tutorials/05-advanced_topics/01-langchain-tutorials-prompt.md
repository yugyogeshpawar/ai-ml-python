# Prompt: A Practical Guide to Building LLM Apps with LangChain

### 1. Title
Generate a tutorial titled: **"LangChain from the Ground Up: Building Your First AI Agent"**

### 2. Objective
To provide a practical, project-based introduction to the LangChain framework. The reader will learn the core components of LangChain by building a functional, tool-using AI agent from scratch, and then learn how to deploy it as a streaming API.

### 3. Target Audience
*   Python developers looking to build applications on top of Large Language Models.
*   AI enthusiasts who want to move from basic scripts to structured, maintainable LLM applications.
*   Students learning about the practical side of AI application development.

### 4. Prerequisites
*   Strong Python programming skills.
*   A basic understanding of what an API is.
*   Familiarity with LLMs at a conceptual level.

### 5. Key Concepts Covered
*   **Core LangChain Components:** LLMs, Chat Models, Prompt Templates, and Output Parsers.
*   **LangChain Expression Language (LCEL):** The `|` pipe syntax for composing chains.
*   **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** The full workflow of loading, splitting, embedding, and retrieving documents.
*   **AI Agents and Tools:** The concept of an agent as a reasoner that can use tools to accomplish tasks.
*   **Conversational Memory:** How to give chains and agents memory of past interactions.
*   **Deployment with LangServe:** How to easily expose a LangChain object as a REST API.

### 6. Open-Source Tools & Libraries
*   **Python 3.x**
*   **LangChain (`langchain`, `langchain-community`, `langchain-openai`, etc.)**
*   **A search tool library (e.g., `duckduckgo-search`)**
*   **FAISS (`faiss-cpu`):** For the RAG vector store.
*   **LangServe and FastAPI:** For deployment.

### 7. Datasets
*   No specific dataset needed. The tutorial will focus on using a live web search tool and a simple text file for the RAG component.

### 8. Step-by-Step Tutorial Structure

**Part 1: The Building Blocks of LangChain**
*   **1.1 Why LangChain?** Explain that LangChain provides the "glue" to connect LLMs with external data and tools.
*   **1.2 The Core Chain with LCEL:**
    *   Introduce the LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) as the modern way to build.
    *   Create the most basic chain: `PromptTemplate | ChatModel | StrOutputParser`.
    *   Explain what each component does and how the `|` operator links them together.

**Part 2: Building a Simple RAG System**
*   **2.1 Goal:** Create a simple Q&A bot that can answer questions about a specific text file.
*   **2.2 The RAG Pipeline:**
    *   **Load & Split:** Use a `TextLoader` and `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`.
    *   **Embed & Store:** Use `HuggingFaceEmbeddings` and `FAISS`.
    *   **Retrieve:** Create a retriever from the vector store.
*   **2.3 Composing the RAG Chain:**
    *   Show how to build a more complex chain with LCEL that takes a question, retrieves relevant documents, formats them into a prompt, and sends them to the LLM.

**Part 3: Creating an AI Research Agent**
*   **3.1 The Need for Agents:** Explain that for complex tasks, we need an LLM that can reason, choose tools, and act in a loop.
*   **3.2 Defining Tools:**
    *   Create two tools for our agent:
        1.  The RAG retriever from Part 2, packaged as a `Tool` for answering questions about the document.
        2.  A `DuckDuckGoSearchRun` tool for general web searches.
*   **3.3 Creating the Agent:**
    *   Use a pre-built agent constructor from LangChain (e.g., `create_openai_tools_agent`).
    *   Combine the LLM, the tools, and a prompt to create the agent `runnable`.
    *   Create an `AgentExecutor` to run the agent loop.
*   **3.4 Testing the Agent:**
    *   Give the agent a question that requires it to use both tools (e.g., "Compare the information in the document with recent news on the same topic").
    *   Show the agent's step-by-step reasoning process.

**Part 4: Adding Memory and Deploying the Agent**
*   **4.1 Making the Agent Conversational:**
    *   Explain the need for memory.
    *   Show how to modify the `AgentExecutor` to include a `ChatMessageHistory` object to remember the conversation.
*   **4.2 Deploying with LangServe:**
    *   Explain that LangServe can turn any LangChain runnable into a production-ready API.
    *   Write a simple `server.py` file.
    *   Import the agent runnable.
    *   Use `add_routes` to attach it to a FastAPI app.
    *   Show how to run the server and interact with the agent via `curl` or a Python `requests` script.

**Part 5: Conclusion**
*   Recap the journey from a simple chain to a deployed, conversational AI agent.
*   Position LangChain as a powerful framework for building complex, data-aware, and tool-using LLM applications.

### 9. Tone and Style
*   **Tone:** Practical, developer-focused, and fast-paced.
*   **Style:** Focus on building. Introduce concepts just before they are needed in the code. Use comments to explain the role of each LangChain class. Keep the theory brief and the coding extensive.
