# Prompt: A Practical Introduction to MLOps

### 1. Title
Generate a tutorial titled: **"MLOps from Dev to Prod: Deploying a Scikit-Learn Model with FastAPI and Docker"**

### 2. Objective
To provide a hands-on, beginner-friendly introduction to the core principles of MLOps (Machine Learning Operations). The reader will learn the end-to-end process of taking a trained machine learning model and deploying it as a robust, scalable, and containerized API.

### 3. Target Audience
*   Data scientists who want to learn how to deploy their models.
*   Software engineers looking to understand the ML deployment lifecycle.
*   Anyone interested in the practical side of putting machine learning into production.

### 4. Prerequisites
*   Solid Python programming skills.
*   Basic familiarity with training a model using a library like `scikit-learn`.
*   Docker installed on their local machine.

### 5. Key Concepts Covered
*   **What is MLOps?** The "Why" behind MLOps: bridging the gap between model development and production.
*   **Model Serialization:** Saving a trained model object to a file (e.g., using `joblib`).
*   **API Development:** Building a simple REST API around the model using **FastAPI**.
*   **Containerization:** Packaging the model, API, and dependencies into a **Docker** container for portability and scalability.
*   **Testing and Interaction:** How to send requests to the deployed model API and receive predictions.

### 6. Open-Source Tools & Libraries
*   **Python 3.x**
*   **scikit-learn:** For training a simple model.
*   **joblib:** For model serialization.
*   **FastAPI:** For building the prediction API.
*   **uvicorn:** As the server to run the FastAPI application.
*   **Docker:** For containerizing the entire application.

### 7. Dataset
*   The classic **Iris dataset**, which is built into `scikit-learn`, is perfect for this task as the focus is on deployment, not model complexity.

### 8. Step-by-Step Tutorial Structure

**Part 1: The MLOps Mindset**
*   **1.1 The Problem:** "You've trained a model in a Jupyter Notebook. Now what?" Discuss the challenges of moving from research to production.
*   **1.2 The Solution:** Introduce MLOps as a set of practices for reliably and efficiently deploying and maintaining models.

**Part 2: Training and Saving the Model**
*   **2.1 Goal:** Create a simple, reproducible script to train a model.
*   **2.2 Implementation (`train.py`):**
    1.  Load the Iris dataset from `scikit-learn`.
    2.  Train a simple `LogisticRegression` or `RandomForestClassifier` model.
    3.  Save the trained model object to a file named `model.joblib` using `joblib.dump()`.

**Part 3: Building the Prediction API with FastAPI**
*   **3.1 Goal:** Create an API that can load the saved model and serve predictions.
*   **3.2 Implementation (`main.py`):**
    1.  Create a new FastAPI app instance.
    2.  Load the `model.joblib` file in the global scope.
    3.  Define a Pydantic class to enforce the structure of the input data (e.g., sepal length, petal width).
    4.  Create a `/predict` endpoint that:
        *   Accepts a POST request with the input data.
        *   Uses the loaded model to make a prediction.
        *   Returns the prediction as a JSON response.

**Part 4: Containerizing the Application with Docker**
*   **4.1 Goal:** Package the entire application into a self-contained Docker image.
*   **4.2 The `requirements.txt` file:**
    *   Create a `requirements.txt` file listing all Python dependencies (`scikit-learn`, `fastapi`, etc.).
*   **4.3 The `Dockerfile`:**
    *   Create a `Dockerfile` and explain each instruction:
        *   `FROM python:3.9-slim`: Start with a base Python image.
        *   `WORKDIR /app`: Set the working directory.
        *   `COPY . .`: Copy the project files (`main.py`, `model.joblib`, `requirements.txt`) into the image.
        *   `RUN pip install -r requirements.txt`: Install the dependencies.
        *   `CMD ["uvicorn", "main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "80"]`: The command to run the API server.
*   **4.4 Building and Running the Container:**
    *   Show the `docker build` command to build the image.
    *   Show the `docker run` command to run the container, including port mapping (`-p 8080:80`).

**Part 5: Testing the Deployed Model**
*   Show how to interact with the running container's API using `curl` or a simple Python `requests` script to confirm that the entire MLOps pipeline is working.

**Part 6: Conclusion**
*   Recap the end-to-end journey from a trained model to a containerized, production-ready API.
*   Discuss next steps in the MLOps lifecycle, such as CI/CD, monitoring, and automated retraining.

### 9. Tone and Style
*   **Tone:** Practical, engineering-focused, and demystifying.
*   **Style:** Treat the process like building any other piece of software. Focus on best practices like separating training from serving. The code should be clean, modular, and production-oriented.
