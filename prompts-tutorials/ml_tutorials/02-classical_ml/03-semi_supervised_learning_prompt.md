# Prompt: A Guide to Semi-Supervised Learning

### 1. Title
Generate a tutorial titled: **"Getting More from Less: An Introduction to Semi-Supervised Learning"**

### 2. Objective
To demonstrate the power and utility of semi-supervised learning, showing how unlabeled data can be leveraged to significantly improve model performance when labeled data is scarce and expensive.

### 3. Target Audience
*   Intermediate machine learning practitioners.
*   Data scientists facing challenges with limited labeled datasets.
*   Researchers working in domains where data labeling is a bottleneck (e.g., medicine, biology).

### 4. Prerequisites
*   Solid understanding of the supervised learning workflow.
*   Experience with `scikit-learn` and `pandas`.
*   Familiarity with the concept of training and test sets.

### 5. Key Concepts Covered
*   The "why" and "what" of Semi-Supervised Learning.
*   **Label Propagation:** An intuitive graph-based algorithm for this task.
*   How to simulate a low-label environment for experimentation.
*   Establishing a supervised baseline for comparison.
*   Quantifying the performance uplift from using unlabeled data.

### 6. Open-Source Tools & Libraries
*   **Python 3.x**
*   **scikit-learn:** For the `LabelPropagation` model and standard classifiers.
*   **pandas & NumPy:** For data handling.
*   **TensorFlow or PyTorch:** Primarily for easy access to the MNIST dataset.

### 7. Dataset
*   **Name:** "MNIST Dataset of Handwritten Digits"
*   **Source:** Built into `tensorflow.keras.datasets` and `torchvision.datasets`.
*   **Description:** A large database of handwritten digits, ideal for classification tasks. Its size makes it perfect for simulating a low-label scenario.

### 8. Step-by-Step Tutorial Structure

**Part 1: The Data Labeling Dilemma**
*   Open with a compelling problem: "In many real-world projects, data is abundant, but labeled data is a rare and costly resource."
*   Introduce semi-supervised learning as a practical solution to this problem.
*   Explain the core idea: using the structure of unlabeled data to inform the learning process.

**Part 2: Experiment Setup**
*   Provide `pip install` commands.
*   Load the full MNIST dataset.
*   **Crucial Step: Create the Low-Label Scenario:**
    *   From the 60,000 training images, randomly sample a tiny fraction (e.g., 100) to be the "labeled set."
    *   The remaining 59,900 images become the "unlabeled set." For these, we only keep the image data (X) and discard the labels (y).
    *   Explain that this simulation mimics a real-world scenario.

**Part 3: The Baseline: What Can We Do With Labeled Data Alone?**
*   Train a standard `SVC` or `LogisticRegression` model using **only** the 100 labeled samples.
*   Evaluate its performance on the full test set. This score is our baseline. Note that it will likely be poor.

**Part 4: The Semi-Supervised Solution: Label Propagation**
*   Introduce the `LabelPropagation` model from `scikit-learn`.
*   Explain its intuition: it builds a graph connecting all data points and "propagates" labels from the few known points to the many unknown points based on proximity.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   Combine the labeled and unlabeled data.
    *   Create a target array where unlabeled samples have a special marker (e.g., -1).
    *   Fit the `LabelPropagation` model on this combined dataset.

**Part 5: The Moment of Truth: Comparing Results**
*   Evaluate the trained `LabelPropagation` model on the same test set.
*   Present a clear, side-by-side comparison of the accuracy scores:
    *   Baseline Model (Supervised Only)
    *   Semi-Supervised Model
*   Highlight the significant performance gain, proving the value of the unlabeled data.

**Part 6: Conclusion**
*   Summarize how semi-supervised learning helped us build a much better model with the same small set of labels.
*   Discuss real-world applications where this technique is invaluable.
*   Briefly mention other semi-supervised methods like "self-training" as a path for further learning.

### 9. Tone and Style
*   **Tone:** Authoritative, clear, and focused on a specific problem-solution narrative.
*   **Style:** Structure the tutorial as an experiment. Use precise language. Ensure the code is clean and the purpose of the simulation is well-explained.
