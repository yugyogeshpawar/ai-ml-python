*   **Matplotlib:** For visualizing data and results.

### 7. Dataset
*   **Name:** "CIFAR-10"
*   **Source:** Available directly through `torchvision.datasets`.
*   **Description:** A dataset of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes (e.g., airplane, automobile, bird, cat).

### 8. Step-by-Step Tutorial Structure

**Part 1: The Fundamentals of PyTorch**
*   **1.1 What is PyTorch?**
    *   Explain PyTorch's two main features: an N-dimensional Tensor library with GPU support and an automatic differentiation system.
*   **1.2 PyTorch Tensors**
    *   Show how to create tensors, perform mathematical operations, and convert between NumPy arrays and PyTorch tensors.
*   **1.3 `autograd`: Automatic Differentiation**
    *   Explain how PyTorch tracks operations to build a computation graph.
    *   Demonstrate how to calculate gradients with `loss.backward()`.

**Part 2: Building and Training a Neural Network**
*   **2.1 Project Goal:** Build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the **CIFAR-10** dataset.
*   **2.2 Handling Data with `Dataset` and `DataLoader`**
    *   Load the CIFAR-10 dataset using `torchvision`.
    *   Define a set of `transforms` to normalize the image data.
    *   Wrap the dataset in a `DataLoader` to handle batching and shuffling.
*   **2.3 Defining the Neural Network**
    *   Create a custom CNN class that inherits from `torch.nn.Module`.
    *   Define the layers (`nn.Conv2d`, `nn.ReLU`, `nn.MaxPool2d`, `nn.Linear`) in the `__init__` method.
    *   Implement the `forward` method to define the data flow through the network.
*   **2.4 The Training Loop**
    *   This is the core of the tutorial. Write the training loop from scratch, clearly explaining each of the following steps inside the loop:
        1.  Get a batch of data from the `DataLoader`.
        2.  Move data and model to the GPU (if available).
        3.  Zero the gradients (`optimizer.zero_grad()`).
        4.  Perform the **forward pass**: feed the input through the model.
        5.  Calculate the **loss** using a criterion like `nn.CrossEntropyLoss`.
        6.  Perform the **backward pass**: compute gradients with `loss.backward()`.
        7.  Update the weights: `optimizer.step()`.
*   **2.5 Evaluation**
    *   Write a separate loop to evaluate the model's performance on the test set, calculating the overall accuracy.

**Part 3: Saving, Loading, and Next Steps**
*   **3.1 Saving and Loading Your Model**
    *   Show how to save and load the model's learned parameters (the `state_dict`) for later use.
*   **3.2 Making Predictions on New Images**
    *   Demonstrate how to load the trained model and use it to classify a single image.
*   **3.3 Conclusion**
    *   Recap the entire process of building a PyTorch model.
    *   Suggest next steps, such as exploring transfer learning with `torchvision.models` or trying more complex projects.

### 9. Tone and Style
*   **Tone:** Clear, conceptual, and empowering. The reader should feel like they are building everything from the ground up.
*   **Style:** Emphasize the "PyTorch-ic" way of doing things. Use diagrams to illustrate the training loop and model architecture. The code should be clean, well-structured, and thoroughly commented.
