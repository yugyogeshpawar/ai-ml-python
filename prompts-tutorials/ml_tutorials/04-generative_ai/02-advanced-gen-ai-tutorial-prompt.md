### 8. Step-by-Step Tutorial Structure

**Part 1: Under the Hood - The Transformer Deep Dive**
*   **1.1 Goal:** To understand the architecture that powers modern LLMs.
*   **1.2 Implementation:**
    *   Visually break down the Transformer block.
    *   Explain the role of self-attention with a step-by-step numerical example.
    *   Provide a simplified PyTorch/TensorFlow implementation of a self-attention layer from scratch.

**Part 2: Efficient Fine-Tuning with PEFT and LoRA**
*   **2.1 The Problem:** Why full fine-tuning of billion-parameter models is often infeasible.
*   **2.2 The Solution: LoRA**
    *   Explain the intuition behind Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA): injecting small, trainable "adapter" matrices instead of updating all the weights.
*   **2.3 Project: Fine-Tuning a Llama 3 Model on a Custom Task**
    *   **Goal:** Specialize a pre-trained LLM for a specific domain (e.g., generating SQL queries).
    *   **Implementation:**
        1.  Load a pre-trained model (e.g., Llama-3-8B) in 4-bit precision using `bitsandbytes` (QLoRA).
        2.  Use the `peft` library to apply LoRA adapters to the model.
        3.  Fine-tune the model on a custom dataset.
        4.  Compare the performance and resource usage against full fine-tuning.

**Part 3: Building a Production-Grade RAG System**
*   **3.1 Beyond Basic RAG:** Discuss the limitations of the simple RAG approach.
*   **3.2 Advanced RAG Techniques:**
    *   **Re-ranking:** Using a second, more sophisticated model to re-rank the retrieved documents for relevance.
    *   **Query Transformation:** Expanding user queries to be more descriptive and yield better search results.
*   **3.3 Implementation:**
    *   Build a RAG pipeline using LangChain or LlamaIndex that incorporates these advanced techniques.

**Part 4: The Future is Agents**
*   **4.1 From Models to Agents:**
    *   Define an AI agent and explain how it differs from a simple chatbot.
    *   Introduce the ReAct (Reason + Act) framework for prompting agents.
*   **4.2 Project: A Simple Research Agent**
    *   **Goal:** Build an agent that can use tools (e.g., a web search API) to answer complex questions.
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   Use LangChain or a similar framework to define an agent.
        *   Provide the agent with a "toolkit" (e.g., a search tool).
        *   Give it a complex prompt and observe its reasoning process as it decides which tool to use.

**Part 5: Conclusion**
*   Recap the advanced techniques covered.
*   Discuss the current frontiers of AI research and the importance of AI safety and alignment.

### 9. Tone and Style
*   **Tone:** Technical, in-depth, and rigorous.
