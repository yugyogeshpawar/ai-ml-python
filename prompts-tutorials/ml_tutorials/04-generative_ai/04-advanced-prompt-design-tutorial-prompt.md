*   A custom evaluation dataset of input/output pairs for the prompt optimization section.

### 8. Step-by-Step Tutorial Structure

**Part 1: Advanced Prompting for Complex Reasoning**
*   **1.1 The Limits of Simple Prompts:** Show a complex reasoning problem where a basic prompt fails.
*   **1.2 Chain-of-Thought (CoT):**
    *   Introduce CoT by showing how instructing a model to "think step-by-step" improves its reasoning. Provide a clear example.
*   **1.3 Self-Consistency:**
    *   Explain this technique: generate multiple CoT responses and take the majority vote for the final answer. Demonstrate how this improves robustness.
*   **1.4 Defensive Prompting:**
    *   Discuss the security risks of prompt injection.
    *   Provide strategies for mitigating these risks, such as using delimiters, instruction defense, and input validation.

**Part 2: Data-Driven Prompt Optimization**
*   **2.1 Moving Beyond Guesswork:** Argue for a systematic, data-driven approach to prompt engineering.
*   **2.2 Building an Evaluation Framework:**
    *   **Goal:** Create a Python-based harness for testing prompts.
    *   **Implementation:**
        1.  Create a small evaluation dataset (e.g., 20 examples) with inputs and ideal outputs.
        2.  Define evaluation metrics: accuracy for structured tasks, and semantic similarity or LLM-as-a-Judge for unstructured tasks.
*   **2.3 Automated Testing with `prompttools`:**
    *   Show how to use a library like `prompttools` to define a set of prompt variations (e.g., different instructions, tones, or examples).
    *   Run the automated test against the evaluation dataset and generate a report comparing the performance, cost, and latency of each variation.

**Part 3: Building Conversational Agents with Memory**
*   **3.1 The Challenge of Memory:** Explain why standard LLM calls are stateless and how this limits conversational ability.
*   **3.2 Architecting a Hybrid Memory System:**
    *   Describe a robust memory system that combines:
        *   A **short-term buffer** for the immediate conversation history.
        *   A **long-term vector store** for retrieving relevant memories from all past conversations.
*   **3.3 Project: A Stateful Research Agent with LangGraph**
    *   **Goal:** Build an agent that can perform a multi-step research task, remembering what it has already done.
    *   **LangGraph Introduction:** Explain how LangGraph allows you to define AI systems as cyclical graphs, which is perfect for agents that need to loop and manage state.
    *   **Implementation:**
        1.  Define a graph with nodes representing actions (e.g., "search_web," "read_document") and edges representing the flow of logic.
        2.  The agent's state will include its plan, past actions, and a summary of findings.
        3.  Run the agent on a research task and show how it uses its state to avoid repeating work and to synthesize information over multiple steps.

**Part 4: Conclusion**
*   Recap the journey from single prompts to complex, stateful AI systems.
*   Emphasize that modern prompt engineering is a rigorous discipline that sits at the intersection of software architecture, data science, and creative writing.

### 9. Tone and Style
*   **Tone:** Advanced, architectural, and systematic.
*   **Style:** Focus on frameworks, workflows, and production-level concerns. Use diagrams to illustrate system architectures and data flows. The code should be robust and well-structured.
