# Python NumPy - Simple Questions

## Basic NumPy and Creating Arrays

1. **What is NumPy?**
   - Briefly describe what NumPy is used for in Python.

2. **Import NumPy**
   - Write the code to import the NumPy library in Python.

3. **Create a 1D Array**
   - Use NumPy to create a 1D array containing the numbers 1 to 5 and print it.

4. **Create a 2D Array**
   - Create a 2D array with values from 1 to 9, arranged in a 3x3 matrix, and print it.

5. **Create a 3D Array**
   - Create a 3D array with shape (2, 2, 3), containing values from 1 to 12, and print it.

6. **Create an Array of Zeros**
   - Create a NumPy array of zeros with a shape of (2, 3) and print it.

7. **Create an Array of Ones**
   - Use NumPy to create a 2x2 array of ones and print it.

8. **Create an Array with Random Values**
   - Create a 1D array of 5 random numbers between 0 and 1.

9. **Create an Array with Range of Values**
   - Create an array containing numbers from 10 to 20 with a step of 2.

10. **Create a Linearly Spaced Array**
    - Use NumPy to create an array of 5 numbers evenly spaced between 0 and 10.

## Array Indexing - 0D, 1D, 2D, and 3D

### 0D Array

11. **Create and Access a 0D Array**
    - Create a 0D array with a single value (e.g., 42) and print it.

### 1D Array Indexing

12. **Access Element in 1D Array**
    - Given `arr = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40])`, print the element at index 2.

13. **Slice a 1D Array**
    - Given `arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])`, print elements from index 1 to 4.

### 2D Array Indexing

14. **Access Element in 2D Array**
    - Given `arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])`, access and print the element in the second row, third column.

15. **Slice a 2D Array**
    - Using the same array, print the first two rows and the first two columns.

16. **Access an Entire Row**
    - From the same array, print the second row.

### 3D Array Indexing

17. **Create and Access Element in 3D Array**
    - Create a 3D array with shape (2, 2, 3) containing values from 1 to 12, then access the element in the first matrix, second row, third column.

18. **Slice a 3D Array**
    - Given a 3D array `arr = np.array([[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], [[7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]]])`, slice and print the first matrix.

### Manipulating Arrays

19. **Change an Element in 1D Array**
    - Given `arr = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40])`, change the second element to 25 and print the result.

20. **Change an Element in 2D Array**
    - Given `arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])`, change the element in the third row, first column to 10 and print the array.
