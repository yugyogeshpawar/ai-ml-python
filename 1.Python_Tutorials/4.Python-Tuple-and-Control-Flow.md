# Python Tuple and Control Flow - Simple Questions

## Python Tuples

1. **Create a Tuple**
   - Create a tuple with the names of your favorite cities and print it.

2. **Access First Item in Tuple**
   - Given a tuple `cities = ('New York', 'Paris', 'Tokyo')`, print the first item in the tuple.

3. **Access Last Item in Tuple**
   - Given the same tuple, print the last item in the tuple.

4. **Access a Range of Tuple Items**
   - Given `numbers = (10, 20, 30, 40, 50)`, print the second to fourth items using slicing.

## Access Tuple Items

5. **Negative Indexing**
   - Given `fruits = ('apple', 'banana', 'cherry')`, access the second last item using negative indexing.

6. **Check if Item Exists in Tuple**
   - Given a tuple `colors = ('red', 'blue', 'green')`, check if "blue" is in the tuple and print the result.

7. **Get Length of Tuple**
   - Given `animals = ('cat', 'dog', 'rabbit')`, print the length of the tuple.

## Unpacking Tuples

8. **Unpack Tuple into Variables**
   - Given a tuple `fruits = ('apple', 'banana', 'cherry')`, unpack its values into three variables and print them.

9. **Unpack Tuple with Asterisk**
   - Use an asterisk (*) to unpack the tuple `numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)` so that one variable gets the first value and another gets the remaining values.

## Update Tuples

10. **Convert Tuple to List and Update Item**
    - Convert the tuple `colors = ('red', 'green', 'blue')` into a list, change "green" to "yellow", and then convert it back into a tuple.

11. **Add Item to Tuple**
    - Append "grape" to the tuple `fruits = ('apple', 'banana')` by converting it to a list and back to a tuple.

12. **Concatenate Tuples**
    - Concatenate the tuples `a = (1, 2, 3)` and `b = (4, 5, 6)` and print the result.

## Loop Tuples

13. **Loop Through Tuple**
    - Loop through the tuple `cities = ('New York', 'Paris', 'Tokyo')` and print each item.

14. **Loop Through Tuple Using Index**
    - Use a `for` loop and `range()` to print each item in `fruits = ('apple', 'banana', 'cherry')` along with its index.

## Tuple Methods

15. **Use `count()` Method**
    - Given `numbers = (1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 2)`, use the `count()` method to count how many times the number 2 appears in the tuple.

16. **Use `index()` Method**
    - Use the `index()` method to find the position of "banana" in `fruits = ('apple', 'banana', 'cherry')`.

## Python If ... Else

17. **Simple If Statement**
    - Write a Python program that checks if a number is positive, and prints "Positive" if it is.

18. **If-Else Statement**
    - Write a Python program that checks if a number is odd or even, and prints "Odd" or "Even" accordingly.

19. **If-Elif-Else Statement**
    - Write a Python program that checks the value of a variable `x`. If `x` is less than 10, print "Small". If `x` is between 10 and 20, print "Medium". Otherwise, print "Large".

20. **Nested If Statements**
    - Write a program to check if a person is eligible to vote. First, check if the person is 18 or older, then check if they are a citizen.

## Python Logical Operators

21. **Using `and`**
    - Write a program to check if a number is between 10 and 50 (inclusive) using the `and` operator.

22. **Using `or`**
    - Write a Python program to check if a person can either drive a car or ride a bike (assume they can drive if they're 18 or older, and ride a bike if they're 16 or older).

23. **Using `not`**
    - Write a program to check if a number is **not** divisible by 2 and 3, and print "Not Divisible" if true.

## Python For Loops

24. **Simple For Loop**
    - Write a `for` loop to print numbers from 1 to 5.

25. **Loop Through String**
    - Write a program to loop through each character in the string `name = 'Python'` and print each character.

26. **Range with For Loop**
    - Write a Python program to print even numbers from 1 to 10 using a `for` loop and `range()`.

27. **For Loop with Break**
    - Write a Python program that loops through numbers from 1 to 10, but stops when it reaches 5.

28. **For Loop with Continue**
    - Write a Python program that loops through numbers from 1 to 10, but skips printing the number 5.

## Advanced For Loops

29. **Nested For Loop**
    - Write a Python program that prints the multiplication table from 1 to 3 using nested loops.

30. **Loop Through List with For**
    - Write a program to loop through the list `fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']` and print each fruit.

31. **Loop Through Dictionary with For**
    - Given a dictionary `person = {'name': 'John', 'age': 25}`, write a program to print both the keys and values.

32. **Use For Loop with Else**
    - Write a Python program that uses a `for` loop to check if a number is prime, and an `else` block to print "Prime" if no divisors are found.

## Python While Loops

33. **Simple While Loop**
    - Write a `while` loop to print numbers from 1 to 5.

34. **While Loop with Condition**
    - Write a `while` loop to print numbers from 10 down to 1.

35. **While Loop with Break**
    - Write a `while` loop that continues until it reaches 5, but breaks if it encounters 3.

36. **While Loop with Continue**
    - Write a `while` loop that skips printing the number 5 but prints all other numbers from 1 to 10.

## Python Logical Operators

37. **Multiple Conditions with Logical Operators**
    - Write a Python program that checks if a number is between 10 and 20 **and** is divisible by 2.

38. **Logical Operator - OR Example**
    - Write a program that checks if a student has passed if their score is 50 or above in **either** math or science.

39. **Not Operator with Condition**
    - Write a Python program that checks if a number is not between 1 and 5, and prints "Out of Range".

## Combining Concepts

40. **Tuple and Loop Combined**
    - Write a program to unpack a tuple `fruits = ('apple', 'banana', 'cherry')` and use a `for` loop to print each fruit.
