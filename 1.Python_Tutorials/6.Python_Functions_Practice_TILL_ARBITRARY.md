### 1. Define a function named `greet` that prints "Hello, World!" when called.
- Call the function `greet`.

### 2. Write a function `add_numbers` that takes two arguments `a` and `b` and returns their sum.
- Call the function with the values `5` and `7`.

### 3. Define a function `multiply` that takes two parameters and returns their product. If no value is passed for the second parameter, it should default to 1.
- Call the function with one argument `6` and then with two arguments `6` and `3`.

### 4. Create a function `describe_pet` that accepts two arguments, a pet name and an animal type (defaulting to 'dog').
- Call the function twice: once passing only a pet name, and once passing both arguments.

### 5. Define a function `greet_people` that takes a list of names and prints a greeting for each person in the list.
- Pass a list of at least 3 names to this function.

### 6. Write a function `calculate_area` that calculates the area of a rectangle. It should take the length and width of the rectangle as parameters.
- Call the function with `length = 10` and `width = 5` and print the result.

### 7. Define a function `concat_strings` that accepts any number of string arguments and returns them concatenated together.
- Call the function with 3 different strings.

### 8. Create a function `count_vowels` that takes a string as an argument and returns the number of vowels in that string.
- Call the function with a sample string.

### 9. Write a function `print_max` that accepts an arbitrary number of arguments and prints the maximum value among them.
- Call the function with at least 4 numbers.

### 10. Define a function `power_of` that takes two arguments: `base` and `exponent`, and returns the base raised to the power of the exponent. Set the default value of the exponent to 2.
- Call the function with just a `base` value and once with both `base` and `exponent` values.
