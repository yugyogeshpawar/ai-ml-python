# Matplotlib Exercises

## Basic Plotting

1. **Simple Line Plot**  
   Create a basic line plot using `matplotlib.pyplot.plot()` with `x = [1, 2, 3, 4]` and `y = [1, 4, 9, 16]`.

2. **Scatter Plot**  
   Create a scatter plot using `x = [1, 2, 3, 4]` and `y = [2, 4, 6, 8]`.

3. **Bar Plot**  
   Create a bar plot for categories `['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']` and values `[3, 7, 8, 5]`.

4. **Histogram**  
   Plot a histogram for the dataset `[1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5]`.

5. **Pie Chart**  
   Create a pie chart for the values `[40, 30, 20, 10]` with labels `['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']`.

## Matplotlib Markers

6. **Adding Markers**  
   Create a line plot with markers for `x = [1, 2, 3, 4]` and `y = [10, 20, 25, 30]`. Use a circle (`'o'`) marker.

7. **Custom Marker Size**  
   Plot a line graph and set marker size to `12` for a dataset of your choice.

8. **Custom Marker Color**  
   Create a scatter plot with custom marker colors using `color='red'`.

9. **Multiple Marker Styles**  
   Create a line plot with different markers at each point: `['o', 's', '^', 'd']`.

10. **Combining Line and Markers**  
    Plot a line graph with markers and change the line style to dashed (`'--'`).

## Matplotlib Lines

11. **Change Line Color**  
    Plot a line graph and set the line color to green.

12. **Change Line Style**  
    Use the dataset `x = [1, 2, 3, 4]` and `y = [10, 20, 30, 40]`. Change the line style to dotted (`':'`).

13. **Change Line Width**  
    Create a line plot and set the line width to `3`.

14. **Multiple Lines**  
    Plot two different lines on the same graph with `x = [1, 2, 3, 4]` and `y1 = [10, 20, 30, 40]`, `y2 = [5, 15, 25, 35]`.

15. **Customizing Each Line**  
    Create two lines with different colors, styles, and markers in one plot.

## Matplotlib Labels and Titles

16. **Adding Title**  
    Plot any dataset of your choice and add the title "My First Plot".

17. **Adding X and Y Labels**  
    Add the x-axis label "Time" and y-axis label "Distance" to a line graph.

18. **Title Font Size**  
    Create a plot and set the title font size to `16`.

19. **Bold Axis Labels**  
    Add bold labels to the x-axis and y-axis.

20. **Customizing Font Family**  
    Plot any graph and set the font family of the title to `"serif"`.

## Matplotlib Adding Grid Lines

21. **Adding Grid Lines**  
    Create a plot and add grid lines.

22. **Change Grid Line Style**  
    Customize the grid line style to dashed (`'--'`).

23. **Set Grid Line Color**  
    Add grid lines to a plot with the color blue.

24. **Change Grid Line Width**  
    Create a plot and increase the grid line width to `2`.

25. **Grid Lines for Only X-Axis**  
    Add grid lines to the x-axis only.

## Advanced Customizations

26. **Plot Custom Range**  
    Plot a line graph for `x = [1, 2, 3, 4]` and `y = [10, 20, 30, 40]`, setting the x-axis range to `[0, 5]` and y-axis range to `[5, 45]`.

27. **Adding Legends**  
    Plot two lines with labels and add a legend to the graph.

28. **Multiple Subplots**  
    Create two subplots: one with a line graph and the other with a bar graph.

29. **Plotting Mathematical Functions**  
    Use Matplotlib to plot the sine and cosine functions in the range `[0, 2Ï€]`.

30. **Save Plot to File**  
    Create a line plot and save it as a PNG file named `my_plot.png`.

## Instructions
1. Use Python and Matplotlib to solve each exercise.
2. Save each plot in a `.py` file or as a Jupyter Notebook cell.
3. Test the plots to ensure they display correctly.
4. Customize the graphs with colors, labels, and titles as needed.
