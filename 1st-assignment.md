## 10. Boolean Variable
Assign is_raining = False. Print a message based on whether it's raining or not.
## 11. Simple Modulo
Create a variable num = 15. Find and print the remainder when divided by 4 using the modulo operator.
## 12. Exponentiation
Create a variable base = 3 and exponent = 4. Calculate base raised to the power of exponent and print the result.
## 13. Swapping Values
Create two variables a = 8 and b = 3. Swap their values and print both.
## 14. Simple Temperature Conversion
Given celsius = 25, calculate the equivalent Fahrenheit temperature using the formula: fahrenheit = (celsius * 9/5) + 32. Print the result.
## 15. Length of a String
Create a variable message = "Hello World". Print the length of the string using the len() function.
## 16. Simple Comparison
