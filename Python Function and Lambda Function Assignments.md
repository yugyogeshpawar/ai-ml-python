# Python Function and Lambda Function Assignments

## Part 1: Python Functions

1. Write a Python function that takes two numbers as input and returns their sum.
2. Create a function that takes a string and returns its reversed version.
3. Write a function to check if a given number is prime.
4. Create a function that takes a list of numbers and returns the largest number.
5. Implement a function that calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion.
6. Write a function to check if a string is a palindrome.
7. Implement a function that takes a list of numbers and returns only the even numbers.
8. Write a function to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit.
9. Create a function that returns the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number of terms.
10. Write a function that accepts a dictionary and returns a new dictionary with keys and values swapped.

## Part 2: Python Lambda Functions

11. Write a lambda function to add two numbers.
12. Create a lambda function to find the square of a given number.
13. Implement a lambda function to check if a number is even or odd.
14. Write a lambda function to calculate the cube of a given number.
15. Create a lambda function that returns the maximum of two numbers.
16. Write a lambda function that takes a list of numbers and returns a new list with each number doubled.
17. Implement a lambda function to filter out odd numbers from a given list.
18. Write a lambda function to sort a list of tuples based on the second element of each tuple.
19. Create a lambda function to concatenate two strings with a space in between.
20. Write a lambda function that takes two arguments and returns their greatest common divisor (GCD).

**Instructions:**
- Implement each function and lambda function in Python.
- Test your functions with sample inputs.
- Write comments in your code to explain each function's purpose.
