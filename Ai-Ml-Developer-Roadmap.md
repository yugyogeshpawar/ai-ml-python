  - Loops (for, while)
  - Conditional statements (if-else, switch-case equivalent)
  - Functions (built-in, user-defined, lambda functions)
  - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
  - Exception Handling (try-except blocks for debugging)
- **Best Practices**:
  - Writing clean and readable code
  - Version control with Git and GitHub
  - Code documentation using docstrings

### 1.2 Mathematics & Statistics
- **Linear Algebra**: Vectors, matrices, eigenvalues/eigenvectors, dot products, matrix transformations.
- **Probability & Statistics**:
  - Measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode)
  - Probability distributions (normal, Poisson, binomial)
  - Hypothesis testing (t-tests, chi-square tests)
- **Calculus**:
  - Understanding derivatives and their role in optimization
  - Partial derivatives and gradients (important for backpropagation)

### 1.3 Data Structures & Algorithms
- **Common Data Structures**: Arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, hash tables.
- **Algorithms**:
  - Sorting (quick sort, merge sort, bubble sort)
  - Searching (binary search, depth-first search, breadth-first search)
  - Dynamic programming (Knapsack problem, Fibonacci series)
  - Greedy algorithms (Huffman coding, Dijkstra’s algorithm)
