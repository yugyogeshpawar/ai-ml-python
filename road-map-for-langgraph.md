# ðŸ§  LangGraph Learning Roadmap (Basic to Advanced)

LangGraph is a framework built on top of LangChain for building **stateful, multi-step, branching workflows** powered by LLMs.

---

## âœ… Prerequisites

Before diving into LangGraph, make sure youâ€™re familiar with:
- Python (intermediate level)
- LangChain basics
- OpenAI or other LLM APIs
- Async programming (helpful)
- Understanding of agents, memory, and tools

---

## ðŸªœ Step-by-Step Topics

### ðŸ”¹ 1. Introduction to LangGraph
- What is LangGraph?
- Differences from LangChain
- Use cases:
  - Multi-agent systems
  - RAG pipelines
  - Stateful chatbots
- Graph-based workflows vs linear chains

---

### ðŸ”¹ 2. Installation & Setup
- Install LangGraph:
  ```bash
  pip install langgraph


* Install dependencies:

  ```bash
  pip install langchain openai
  ```
* Set up API keys and config
* Basic project structure

---

### ðŸ”¹ 3. Core Concepts

| Concept         | Description                                    |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Nodes**       | Functions, chains, or agents in your workflow  |
| **Edges**       | Define transitions between nodes               |
| **State**       | Carries information throughout the graph       |
| **Graph**       | Directed graph combining all nodes and edges   |
| **Cycles**      | Allow loops within the graph                   |
| **Concurrency** | Multiple nodes running in parallel             |
| **Branching**   | Choose node paths based on logic or LLM output |

---

### ðŸ”¹ 4. Your First Graph

* Create a simple LangGraph with 2 nodes
* Pass state from one to the next
* Observe flow and output

---

### ðŸ”¹ 5. Working with State

* Define custom state objects
* Update and access state between nodes
* Track memory, history, etc.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 6. Agents in LangGraph

* Use LangChain agents as graph nodes
* Add tools to agents
* Use memory within agents
* Multi-agent communication and decision-making

---

### ðŸ”¹ 7. Branching Logic

* Conditional edges based on:

  * State
  * Model output
  * Function returns
* Example: If user asks a math question â†’ use calculator agent

---

### ðŸ”¹ 8. Loops and Iteration

* Create cycles within the graph
* Set limits on iterations
* Example use cases:

  * Self-refinement loops
  * RAG with feedback

---

### ðŸ”¹ 9. Parallelism

* Run nodes in parallel
* Fork/Join patterns
* Compare outputs from different agents/tools concurrently

---

### ðŸ”¹ 10. Memory Integration

* Integrate LangChain memory into the graph
* Summarize history
* Store/retrieve contextual information

---

### ðŸ”¹ 11. Advanced Use Cases

* Multi-agent simulation (AutoGPT style)
* RAG + QA + summarization
* Human-in-the-loop review systems
* Planners and Executors

---

### ðŸ”¹ 12. Deployment

* Run LangGraph in production with:

  * FastAPI
  * LangServe
  * Serverless options
* Best practices for deployment

---

### ðŸ”¹ 13. Testing and Debugging

* Unit testing nodes
* Debugging workflows
* Visualizing graph execution
* Logging tools and tips

---

### ðŸ”¹ 14. Real-World Project Ideas

* AI assistant with memory and tools
* Multi-agent debate/discussion engine
* Autonomous research agent
* Contextual chatbot with RAG and planning
